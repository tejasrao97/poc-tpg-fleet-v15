# patch-plan.sh WORKFLOW_NAME
# tpg-patch, before anything changes (Round 14, design decisions D76 to D79): for
# every target cluster, on a clone of the fleet branch,
#   1 render the targets as they are now (the "before" objects)
#   2 store the patch files the run received (input patchFiles, or repo: files of
#     the fleet branch) and make them current in clusters/fleet.yaml (patch-lib.sh
#     patch_prepare): postgresValues and operator files under their UID names; the
#     postgres documents (Round 15, D81) combined with the kinds the current file
#     carries into one file per instance; check them against clusters/fleet.yaml
#     and the cluster (lib.sh patch_postgres_errors, patch_values_errors):
#       postgres files   Postgres: no spec.postgresVersion (tpg-upgrade),
#                        spec.highAvailability (tpg-scale-instance),
#                        spec.storageClassName, the Service fields (the exposure
#                        values of a values patch set them); storageSize and
#                        walStorageSize not smaller. PostgresBackupLocation: no other
#                        storage type, secret, enableSSL, caBundle, additionalParameters,
#                        forcePathStyle. PostgresBackupSchedule: no sourceInstance,
#                        type, expire; only the instance's own schedules
#       values files     no instance.name, instance.postgresVersion,
#                        instance.highAvailability, instance.storageClassName,
#                        instance.serviceType, cluster, patches, valuesOverride,
#                        backup.enableSSL, backup.caBundle; sizes not smaller; no
#                        backup.additionalParameters, backup.forcePathStyle (ignored
#                        by the tpg-instances ApplicationSet on a running instance).
#                        May switch the backup scheduler (D70) and FerretDB (D71): the
#                        chart refuses the combinations the workflow inputs refuse
#       operator values  operatorImage only with the tag of the cluster's operator
#                        version (another registry, not another version); the pull
#                        Secret, ClusterIssuer and namespace it names must exist
#       patchMode=clear  clearKinds names the kinds whose current file is removed
#     After the render, a postgres document that overrides a chart value is the
#     warning PATCH_OVERRIDES_VALUE, one whose object the instance does not render
#     PATCH_TARGET_NOT_RENDERED (D82).
#     The validate step has checked the type of each file already (patchcheck.py).
#   3 render the targets with the new clusters/fleet.yaml (helm template) and send
#     them through the API server (--dry-run=server): a render or admission error
#     BLOCKs the cluster (PATCH_REFUSED) and names the error
#   4 print the diff: objects the patch no longer renders, and kubectl diff
#     --server-side of the rendered objects against the live ones. A target with
#     no difference is NO_CHANGE and is not synced; a cluster without any is not
#     planned.
# Nothing is committed here: patch-cluster.sh does the same on a fresh clone under
# the cluster mutex, then commits (pushMode direct, or a pull request branch), syncs
# and verifies. The UID names are chosen once for the run (record patch.names).
#
# Records precheck.<cluster> (PASSED | BLOCKED | NO_CHANGE), plan.<cluster> (the
# targets with a change) and result.git.
