# tpg-day0 and tpg-create-instance, after the pre-check (design decision D61):
# write the planned clusters/fleet.yaml entries of every cluster whose
# pre-check is PASSED or MANAGED, and nothing for a BLOCKED cluster. The plan
# (fleet-day0.sh) started from BASE_FLEET_JSON; a cluster whose entry in Git
# changed since then is not overwritten (FLEET_CHANGED_DURING_RUN).
# The plans carry every CA bundle as a placeholder @ca:<hash>@ (lib.sh plan_json);
# HEAD is compared in the same form and the bundles are restored when written.
# dryRun=true: log the change and push nothing. Otherwise commit with
# PUSH_MODE (direct | pr). Records result.git.
