# patch-cluster.sh WORKFLOW_NAME CLUSTER TIMEOUT_SECONDS
# tpg-patch, one cluster, under the mutex tpg-cluster-<cluster> (Round 14, design
# decisions D78 and D79). patch-plan.sh has checked every cluster and recorded
# plan.<cluster> (the targets whose objects the patch changes).
#   1 A fresh clone of the fleet branch (BASE, its head commit): the checks, the
#     render, the server-side dry run and the diff of patch-plan.sh again (patch-lib.sh),
#     so a change on the fleet branch since the plan is seen. No difference any
#     more: NO_CHANGE, nothing is committed.
#   2 One commit: the stored patch files, clusters/fleet.yaml (current and previous)
#     and, for the operator, patches/operator/clusters/<cluster>.yaml.
#       pushMode=pr      on the branch tpg/patch/<workflow>/<cluster>, with a pull
#                        request into the fleet branch (its body carries the diff)
#       pushMode=direct  on the fleet branch
#   3 The Applications of the targets are synced at that commit, the operator first
#     (source 2 of the multi-source Application, where the fleet repository is), then
#     the instances (with prune), and verified: the operator pods and CRD, the
#     instance pods until Running, FerretDB and the Services.
#   4 pushMode=pr: the workflow waits for a person to merge the pull request
#     (prTimeoutSeconds). Merged: the Applications compare the new fleet branch head
#     with what was synced from the branch, the same objects, so they turn Synced
#     without a second sync (app_expect_synced checks it). Closed or not merged in
#     time: reverted (5), FAILED PR_NOT_MERGED.
#   5 A failed sync or check (or PR_NOT_MERGED) reverts:
#       pushMode=pr      the pull request is closed first, so nobody can merge it
#                        any more; each Application is synced back (at the fleet
#                        branch head of step 1 when it was Synced before this step,
#                        otherwise at the commit it was last synced at) and the
#                        branch deleted (its commit goes with it). A pull request a
#                        person merged before the failure is undone like direct:
#       pushMode=direct  a git revert of the commit (of the merge) is pushed, with
#                        every stored patch file clusters/fleet.yaml still names
#                        taken back from the reverted commit (another cluster of
#                        the run may use the same file), and the Applications are
#                        synced at it
#     then FAILED with the reason of the failure; later batches do not run.
# Records result.<cluster>.operator and result.<cluster>.<instance>.
