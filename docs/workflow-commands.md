# Workflow command reference

Every tpg operation is an Argo Workflows `WorkflowTemplate` in the `argo` namespace on the hub. You start a run with the **argo CLI** (`argo submit --from workflowtemplate/<name>`). Argo CD does not start workflows: the workflows call the Argo CD API to refresh and sync Applications. The **argocd CLI** commands at the end of this page inspect what the workflows did; people cannot sync the tpg target Applications themselves (section 20).

Every input has a type (section 2). A Workflow whose inputs do not match their types is rejected when it is submitted, and no Workflow is created. Mandatory inputs have no default: a run without them fails in its first step (`validate`), which lists every missing or invalid input, including the registered cluster names.

Every workflow can also be started with an interactive script, `scripts/submit/tpg-<workflow>.sh`, that asks for the mandatory inputs first and then offers the optional ones in a menu (section 17).

## 1. Set up the CLIs

```bash
# Kubeconfig written by tpg-aks-infra/scripts/run.sh (context aks-tpg-hub)
export KUBECONFIG=~/src/tpg-aks-infra/.work/kubeconfig
export ARGO_NAMESPACE=argo            # every command below then works without -n argo

argo version
argo template list
```

To use the Argo Workflows server instead of the Kubernetes API (for example from a laptop without cluster access), see `tpg-aks-infra/docs/README-argo-on-aks.md` and set `ARGO_SERVER`, `ARGO_HTTP1=true`, `ARGO_SECURE=true` and `ARGO_TOKEN`.

```bash
# argocd CLI against the hub (port-forward works without a public UI)
kubectl --context aks-tpg-hub -n argocd port-forward svc/argocd-server 18080:443 >/dev/null 2>&1 &
argocd login localhost:18080 --username admin --insecure --grpc-web \
  --password "$(kubectl --context aks-tpg-hub -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d)"
```

## 2. Input types and conventions

Argo Workflows passes every input as a string. The types below are declared once in `workflows/params/types.yaml` and enforced by the hub's Kubernetes API server (ValidatingAdmissionPolicy `tpg-workflow-parameters`, generated from that file). The check applies to `argo submit`, the Argo UI, the API and CronWorkflows alike. A rejected submission names every wrong input and its type, for example:

```text
tpg-day0: maxParallel="abc" must be an Integer (1 or more); dryRun="yes" must be a Boolean (true or false). See docs/workflow-commands.md
tpg-scale-instance: cluster is not an input of tpg-scale-instance. See docs/workflow-commands.md
```

| Type | Accepted values | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `List` | Comma-separated names (lowercase DNS labels). Where the table says so, `all` selects every registered cluster or every declared instance. `components` takes `auto`, or a list of `cert-manager`, `vso` and `monitoring` | `aks-tpg-poc-01,aks-tpg-poc-02`, `all` |
| `String (file path)` | One file: a path of the machine that submits the run (absolute, `~/` or relative, `..` allowed), whose contents go in `patchFiles`, or `repo:<path>` in the fleet repository (Round 15). A patch file is `.yaml` or `.yml`, a CA bundle `.pem`, `.crt` or `.cer` | `./orders-backup.yaml`, `~/certs/azure.pem`, `repo:charts/tpg-instance/patches/team.yaml` |
| `List (file paths)` | Comma-separated `String (file path)` values of `.yaml` or `.yml` files | `./orders.yaml, repo:charts/tpg-instance/patches/team.yaml` |
| `List (kinds)` | Comma-separated patch kinds: `Postgres`, `PostgresBackupLocation`, `PostgresBackupSchedule`, `PostgresFerretDocumentDB`, `postgresValues`, `operatorValues`; or `all` alone | `PostgresBackupSchedule,postgresValues` |
| `String (Vault token)` | A Vault wrapping token, as `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/vault-secret.sh wrap` prints it | `hvs.CAESIJ...` |
| `List (CIDRs)` | Comma-separated IPv4 or IPv6 networks with the host bits zero | `10.20.0.0/16,192.168.10.0/24` |
| `List (host names)` | Comma-separated DNS names; `*.` in front matches every subdomain | `api.example.com,*.example.org` |
| `String` | Any text | `alpine/k8s:1.35.8` |
| `String (name)` | One lowercase DNS label (a Kubernetes object name for `backupName`, `ferretSecretName` and `ferretReadOnlySecretName`) | `orders-db` |
| `String (cron)` | A cron schedule of 5 fields: minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week (UTC) | `0 0 * * 0` |
| `String (Azure name)` | An Azure resource name: letters, digits, `-`, `_` and `.`, at most 80 characters | `aks-apps_subnet` |
| `String (version)` | Operator: `v4.5.0` (`4.5.0` is accepted). Postgres: `postgres-17.6` (`17.6` is accepted; the version must exist in `kubectl get postgresversion`) | `v4.5.1`, `postgres-16.10` |
| `String (quantity)` | A Kubernetes quantity | `20Gi`, `500m`, `2` |
| `String (UTC time)` | `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ` | `2026-09-15T08:30:00Z` |
| `String (LSN)` | A log sequence number | `0/3000060` |
| `Boolean` | `true` or `false` | `true` |
| `Integer` | Digits only. Counts can be 0; timeouts and `maxParallel` start at 1 | `3`, `1800` |
| `Enum` | One of the values in the Description column | `direct` |
| `Map` | YAML or JSON (section 3) | `{"aks-tpg-poc-01": {"instances": {"orders-db": {"replicas": 2}}}}` |
| `Map (JSON)` | A JSON object | `{"aks-tpg-poc-01": ["tpg-operator"]}` |

Inputs used by several workflows:

| Common input | Type | Values | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clusters` | `List` | Registered clusters, or `all` where accepted | every workflow except restore |
| `instances` | `List` | Declared instances, or `all` where accepted (new instances for create-instance) | day0, create-instance, upgrade, patch, scale, network-policy, backup, delete-instance |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | Targets with per-cluster and per-instance values (section 3); replaces `clusters` and `instances` | day0, create-instance, upgrade, patch, scale, network-policy, backup, delete-instance, delete-apps |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | `direct`: push the `clusters/fleet.yaml` change to the fleet branch. `pr`: push a branch, open a GitHub pull request and continue once it is merged (`prTimeoutSeconds`, default 3600). tpg-patch syncs the pull request branch before the merge (section 7) | day0, create-instance, upgrade, patch, scale, network-policy, delete-apps, delete-instance, restore |
| `dryRun` | `Boolean` | `true`: validate and record the plan; change nothing | day0, create-instance, upgrade, patch, scale, network-policy, delete-apps, helm-addons |
| `rolloutMode` | `Enum` | `canary` (default): the wave-0 cluster alone, then the other waves in batches of `maxParallel`. `batches`: no canary, batches of `maxParallel` in wave order. `all`: every selected cluster in one batch | day0, create-instance, upgrade, patch, network-policy |

- Put values that contain commas, spaces or JSON in single quotes.
- `-p name=value` sets one input. `--parameter-file inputs.yaml` reads several from a file (examples in each section, for one cluster and for several with `clusterMap`). In a parameter file, quote `true`, `false` and numbers, and write `clusterMap` as a block (`clusterMap: |`). A `-p` after `--parameter-file` overrides the file (for example `-p dryRun=true`). Files of your machine that the parameter file names are packed into it with `scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o <parameter file>` (section 7).
- `--watch` follows the run in the terminal. Without it, the command prints the workflow name.
- `--name` or `--generate-name` sets the workflow name, which is also the results ConfigMap `tpg-run-<name>`.
- Every run ends with a report (exit handler). `argo logs @latest -c main | sed -n '/tpg run report/,$p'` prints it again. Warnings (section 19) have their own part of the report.
- Instance lists are checked against `clusters/fleet.yaml` before anything changes: an instance that is not declared on a selected cluster fails the run with `UNKNOWN_INSTANCE` and the list of declared instances.
- While a step waits for pods (Helm releases, the operator, instances, upgrades, scale, patch, restore), it prints the pod table of the namespace every 5 seconds and stops as soon as a pod cannot start. The failure reason is `POD_<REASON>` (for example `POD_CRASHLOOPBACKOFF`, `POD_CREATECONTAINERCONFIGERROR`, `POD_UNSCHEDULABLE`), followed in the log by the pod's status, events and the logs of the failing container. `CreateContainerConfigError`, `CreateContainerError`, `InvalidImageName` and `RunContainerError` fail at once; `CrashLoopBackOff`, `ImagePullBackOff`/`ErrImagePull`, `Error` and `OOMKilled` after 60 seconds; an unschedulable or Pending pod after 5 minutes.
- Transient API errors (timeouts, connection resets, HTTP 429/502/503/504) of `kubectl`, `helm`, `az` and the Argo CD API are retried up to 5 times with 5, 10, 20 and 40 seconds between attempts (`TPG_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `TPG_RETRY_DELAY`); the log shows `<tool> <verb>: transient error (attempt n/5), retrying in Ns: <error>`.
- Argo CD syncs are made at the fleet commit the run pushed; a sync the API server rejects (admission webhook, invalid field) fails the step at once with Argo CD's message.
- `toolsImage` (`String`, default `alpine/k8s:1.35.8`) is the image every step runs in. It is an input of every workflow and is not listed in the tables below.
- Some combinations are refused as well, by the same admission policy (`rules` in `workflows/params/types.yaml`), by the submit scripts and by the `validate` step (which also checks the values `clusterMap` gives each instance): `highAvailability=true` with `readReplicas=0` (a single node is `highAvailability=false`), `readReplicas` above 0 with `highAvailability=false` (read replicas need high availability), and `ferretReadOnlyReplicas` above 0 with `highAvailability=false` (the read-only FerretDB proxies connect to the standby). `highAvailability` and `readReplicas` are checked where they are set: both as inputs, or both on one `clusterMap` entry (an entry's own keys, the inputs filling what it leaves out). An input `readReplicas` is a default for HA instances only: it does not apply to an entry that sets `highAvailability: false` itself. `fleet-day0.sh` refuses the same pairs again before it writes anything (it no longer turns a `readReplicas` above 0 into 0).
- `clusters/fleet.yaml` is written in block YAML. Every workflow that commits it (the tpg-day0 and tpg-create-instance commit step included, which copies each cluster from its JSON plan) turns every flow map and list in the file into block style first, so an entry written as JSON by an earlier version, or a hand-written `{a: b}`, becomes block YAML with the next commit. Quotes stay only where YAML needs them (`"true"`, `"0"`), a comment at the end of a flow line moves above its content, and `caBundle` stays a literal block.
- **Zero defaults are not written** (design decision D69). The tpg-instance chart leaves out of every object it renders the fields that hold their zero default (`false`, `0`, `[]`, `{}`): a single-node instance gets no `spec.highAvailability` block at all (the operator's defaults are `enabled: false` and `readReplicas: 0`). A field left out takes the same default, so declaring it gains nothing, and a declared field that a writer drops leaves the Application OutOfSync (the PostgresBackupLocation drift of Round 9, the single-node reports of Round 12). `clusters/fleet.yaml` keeps the explicit values (`enabled: false`, `readReplicas: 0`), since `clusters/_template/instance.yaml` defaults to `true` and `1`. The fields come from the registry `charts/tpg-instance/files/zero-defaults.yaml`, generated from the 9 live CRDs in `charts/crd-reference` (`charts/crd-reference/README.md`, section 3). A field whose default is not zero is always written: `enableSSL: false` stays, because its CRD default is `true`.

## 3. clusterMap

`clusterMap` selects the targets of a run (clusters, and the instances on each) and carries values that differ per cluster or per instance. It is optional. A run takes either `clusterMap` or the `clusters` and `instances` inputs, not both. The other inputs stay the defaults of every target, and a map key overrides them for one cluster or one instance.

```yaml
<cluster>:                  # a registered cluster
  <cluster key>: <value>
  instances:
    <instance>:             # an instance (namespace pg-<instance>)
      <instance key>: <value>
```

It is written as YAML or JSON. Values can be YAML booleans and numbers (`true`, `2`); a Postgres version written as a number (`16.10`) keeps its trailing zero. List values are YAML lists or comma-separated strings, map values are YAML or JSON maps of strings. A key set to `null`, or to an empty list or map, is refused: remove the key to use the default. The accepted keys are listed in `workflows/params/cluster-map-keys.yaml`; adding a key is one entry there. The `validate` step checks the whole map before anything changes:

- every cluster is registered, and every name is a DNS label;
- every key exists and the workflow accepts it (an unknown key names the closest known one: `replica` gives "did you mean replicas?"; an invalid name shows a valid form: `orders_db` gives "for example orders-db"; an unregistered cluster names the closest registered one);
- every value has the key's type;
- every required value is present, from the map key or from the workflow input of the same name;
- day0, create-instance, network-policy, backup and delete-instance need at least one instance per cluster. In upgrade, patch, scale and delete-apps, a cluster without instances must carry its cluster-level action (`operatorVersion`, an operator values file or `clearKinds`, `maxReadReplicas`, `deleteOperator`).
- the keys renamed in Round 15 (`valuesPatchFilePath`, `enableSSL`) are refused with their new names (`postgresValuesPatchFilePath`, `backupEnableSSL`).

Every key below comes from `workflows/params/cluster-map-keys.yaml`, as do the JSON Schema of each workflow's map (`workflows/params/schemas/clustermap-<workflow>.schema.json`, and the same schema as `.schema.yaml`) and an example map per workflow (`clustermap-<workflow>.example.yaml`). An editor with the YAML language server checks a map file against its schema when the file starts with `# yaml-language-server: $schema=<path to the schema>`; `check-jsonschema --schemafile workflows/params/schemas/clustermap-patch.schema.json map.yaml` checks it on the command line. A map in a parameter file is a string (`clusterMap: |`): check the map itself, not the parameter file. The schema checks the shape and the value types; the `validate` step of the run also checks what a schema cannot (registered clusters, values a workflow input supplies, CIDR host bits, the combinations below).

Keys per workflow (`required`: the key, or the workflow input named; `guard`: when set, an instance
that runs another version is skipped). The schema of each map is
`workflows/params/schemas/clustermap-<workflow>.schema.json` (also `.schema.yaml`), with an example
map that uses every key in `clustermap-<workflow>.example.yaml`:

`tpg-day0` (`clustermap-day0.schema.json`):

## 4. tpg-day0

Plans the inputs into `clusters/fleet.yaml`, pre-checks every selected cluster, writes the plan of the clusters that passed (one commit), installs cert-manager (and the standalone monitoring agent) as Helm releases, then syncs the operator and instance Applications: by default wave 0 alone first, then the other waves in batches of `maxParallel` (`rolloutMode`). Each cluster is deployed under the mutex `tpg-cluster-<cluster>`, so no other tpg workflow changes it at the same time. A cluster that fails the pre-check gets no `fleet.yaml` entries and is not changed; the others go ahead, and the run ends `Failed` in its last step (`gate`), with the blocked clusters and their reasons in the report.

The operator step waits until the Postgres CRDs are Established and the operator Deployment is available on the target, then hard-refreshes the Application, so it does not wait for the Argo CD cache. An instance is ready when the Postgres resource reports `Running` and its StatefulSets are ready; Argo CD shows it Progressing until then.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clusters` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Registered clusters or `all` |
| `instances` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Instances to deploy on every selected cluster (namespace `pg-<instance>`) |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | no | | Targets and per-target values (section 3); replaces `clusters` and `instances` |
| `highAvailability` | `Boolean` | yes (input or map key) | | `true` (primary and standby, plus `readReplicas`) or `false` (single node) |
| `operatorVersion` | `String (version)` | yes (input or map key) | | Operator chart version |
| `postgresVersion` | `String (version)` | yes (input or map key) | | PostgresVersion name |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | yes | | `direct` or `pr` |
| `readReplicas` | `Integer` | no | `1` with `highAvailability=true` | Read replicas, only with `highAvailability=true`: 1 to `maxReadReplicas` (default 3); empty means 1, 0 is refused. With `highAvailability=false` leave it empty (or 0): the instance is a single node, written as `readReplicas: 0`, and a value above 0 is refused |
| `storageSize`, `walStorageSize` | `String (quantity)` | no | template (`20Gi`, `10Gi`) | Volume sizes |
| `storageClass` | `String (name)` | no | template (`tpg-data-retain`) | StorageClass |
| `cpu`, `memory` | `String (quantity)` | no | template (requests 1/2Gi, limits 2/4Gi) | Request and limit per Postgres pod |
| `backupSchedule` | `Enum` | no | `fleet` | `fleet`: included in `tpg-backup-full` and `tpg-backup-incr`; `none`: excluded; `operator`: excluded, and the operator backs the instance up on its own PostgresBackupSchedule objects (`operatorFullSchedule`, `operatorIncrementalSchedule`; section 13). A re-run writes this input too: repeat `backupSchedule=operator` (or `none`) for the instances that use it, or the entry returns to `fleet` and the sync removes the schedules |
| `operatorFullSchedule` | `String (cron)` | no | `0 0 * * 0` | `backupSchedule=operator`: cron (UTC) of the full backups |
| `operatorIncrementalSchedule` | `String (cron)` | no | `0 0 * * 1-6` | `backupSchedule=operator`: cron (UTC) of the incremental backups; empty: full backups only |
| `installAddons` | `Boolean` | no | `true` | Install or upgrade cert-manager (and the standalone monitoring agent) |
| `existingAddons` | `Enum` | no | `skip` | A Helm release that differs: `skip` or `upgrade` (section 12) |
| `monitoringOption` | `Enum` | no | `tpg-settings` | Override: `none`, `azure`, `standalone` |
| `backupEnableSSL` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | `enableSSL` of the instances' `PostgresBackupLocation`: `false` uses HTTP to Azure Blob (the storage account must accept HTTP, Terraform `backup_storage_https_only = false`); `true` uses HTTPS and writes a CA bundle as `caBundle` (the two inputs below, else `tpg-settings` `backupCaBundle` from Terraform) |
| `backupCaBundleFile` | `String (file path)` | no | | `backupEnableSSL=true`: the CA bundle, a PEM file (`.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`) of the submitting machine (its contents in `patchFiles`) or `repo:ca-bundles/<file>` in the fleet repository. Not with `backupCaBundleVaultSecret`; a `clusterMap` key of the instance or its cluster wins (section 14) |
| `backupCaBundleVaultSecret` | `String (name)` | no | | `backupEnableSSL=true`: the CA bundle from Vault `tpg/ca-bundles/<name>` (key `caBundle`; `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/vault-secret.sh ca put`). Not with `backupCaBundleFile` (section 14) |
| `backupFullRetention` | `Integer` | no | template (`4`) | Full backups the backup location keeps (`retentionPolicy.fullRetention.number`, applied by the operator), 1 or more |
| `backupFullRetentionType` | `Enum` | no | template (`count`) | `count`: `backupFullRetention` is a number of full backups; `time`: a number of days. A change restarts the instances that use the backup location (operator 4.5 documentation) |
| `postgresPatchFilePath` | `List (file paths)` | no | | New instances: files of `Postgres`, `PostgresBackupLocation`, `PostgresBackupSchedule` and `PostgresFerretDocumentDB` documents (section 7), paths of the submitting machine (absolute, `~/` or relative, contents in `patchFiles`) or `repo:charts/tpg-instance/patches/<file>`. An instance that already runs with other patch files is `BLOCKED` `PATCH_USE_TPG_PATCH` |
| `postgresValuesPatchFilePath` | `String (file path)` | no | | New instances: a tpg-instance chart values file (section 7) |
| `operatorValuesPatchFilePath` | `String (file path)` | no | | The operator values file, applied when the run installs the operator (a local path or `repo:patches/operator/<file>`). A running operator with another file is `BLOCKED` `PATCH_USE_TPG_PATCH` |
| `patchFiles` | `Map (JSON)` | no | | The contents of the local files the path inputs and `clusterMap` name, `{"<path as given>": "<base64>"}`. Written by `scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o <parameter file>` (section 7), never typed |
| `exposure` | `Enum` | no | `clusterIP` | Read-write Service of each instance: `clusterIP` (inside the cluster), `internalLoadBalancer` (Azure internal load balancer, an IP of the cluster VNet) or `loadBalancer` (public IP) |
| `serviceAnnotations` | `Map` | no | | Extra annotations of the read-write Service, for example `{service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: orders}` |
| `readOnlyExposure` | `Enum` | no | `clusterIP` | Read-only Service of an HA instance, same values |
| `readOnlyServiceAnnotations` | `Map` | no | | Extra annotations of the read-only Service |
| `allowedSourceRanges` | `List (CIDRs)` | no | | Client ranges a load balancer accepts (annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-allowed-ip-ranges`) |
| `internalLoadBalancerSubnet` | `String (Azure name)` | no | | `internalLoadBalancer`: subnet of the cluster VNet for the load balancer IP (empty: the node subnet) |
| `networkPolicy` | `Enum` | no | `none` | `none`, or `baseline`: default deny plus the flows the instance needs, then the rules below (section 9) |
| `ingressFromNamespaces` | `List` | no | | `baseline`: namespaces whose pods may connect on 5432 |
| `ingressFromPodLabels` | `Map` | no | | `baseline`: pod labels allowed on 5432, in `ingressFromNamespaces` or in any namespace |
| `ingressFromCidrs` | `List (CIDRs)` | no | | `baseline`: client ranges allowed on 5432 (clients through a load balancer) |
| `egressToCidrs` | `List (CIDRs)` | no | | `baseline`: extra ranges the instance pods may reach |
| `egressToFqdns` | `List (host names)` | no | | `baseline`: host names the instance pods may reach; needs ACNS (Terraform `acns_enabled`) |
| `ferret` | `Boolean` | no | | `true`: a FerretDB (MongoDB wire protocol on 27017, PostgresFerretDocumentDB, Tech Preview) for each instance; `false`: none (removes it); empty: an existing instance keeps what it has. Needs Postgres 17.5 or later and the documentdb extension, which you prepare by hand (below) |
| `ferretReplicas` | `Integer` | no | `1` | FerretDB read-write proxies (1 or more) |
| `ferretReadOnlyReplicas` | `Integer` | no | `0` | FerretDB read-only proxies on the standby; above 0 needs `highAvailability=true` |
| `ferretExposure` | `Enum` | no | `clusterIP` | FerretDB Services `ferretdb-rw-<instance>` and `ferretdb-ro-<instance>`: `clusterIP`, `internalLoadBalancer` or `loadBalancer`, with the instance's `allowedSourceRanges` and `internalLoadBalancerSubnet` |
| `ferretSecretName` | `String (name)` | no | `<instance>-app-user-db-secret` | Connection Secret of the read-write proxies (created by the operator with the instance) |
| `ferretReadOnlySecretName` | `String (name)` | no | `<instance>-read-only-user-db-secret` | Connection Secret of the read-only proxies |
| `maxParallel` | `Integer` | no | `2` | Clusters per batch after the canary |
| `rolloutMode` | `Enum` | no | `canary` | `canary`, `batches` or `all` (section 2) |
| `dryRun` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | Show the `fleet.yaml` change and run the pre-check only |
| `syncTimeoutSeconds`, `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `1800`, `3600` | Timeouts |

The pre-check is read-only and runs before anything is written to Git. A cluster that fails it is `BLOCKED`:

| Reason | The cluster is blocked when |
|---|---|
| `FOREIGN_OPERATOR`, `FOREIGN_CRD` | An operator Deployment or a Postgres CRD exists that the cluster's operator Application (`tpg-<cluster>-operator`) does not manage. The operator Deployment (found by its label `app=postgres-operator` or by its image) is ours when its Argo CD tracking annotation names that Application. A CRD is ours when the Application lists it in its resource list or its annotation names it, because the CRDs, installed from the chart's `crds/` directory, carry no annotation. A cluster the fleet deployed is `MANAGED`, never foreign |
| `INSTANCE_NAME_IN_USE` | A Postgres of a requested name exists that its instance Application does not manage |
| `VERSION_NOT_AVAILABLE` | A requested Postgres version is not offered by the running operator (`kubectl get postgresversion`) |
| `AZURE_BACKUP_UNSUPPORTED` | The PostgresBackupLocation CRD on the target has no `spec.storage.azure` (or no `caBundle` for `backupEnableSSL=true`). The 4.5 documentation lists S3 and GCS only; the workflows rely on the live CRD |
| `PGDATA_POOL_NOT_HA_CAPABLE` | `highAvailability=true` and the pool labelled `tpg.fleet/pool=postgres` has fewer than 3 Ready nodes across zones 1, 2 and 3 |
| `CILIUM_NOT_AVAILABLE` | `networkPolicy=baseline` and the cluster has no CiliumNetworkPolicy (Azure CNI powered by Cilium) |
| `ACNS_NOT_ENABLED` | `egressToFqdns` is set and `tpg-settings` `acnsEnabled` is not `true` |
| `FERRET_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` | `ferret=true` for an instance below Postgres 17.5 |
| `FERRET_CRD_MISSING` | `ferret=true` and the running operator has no PostgresFerretDocumentDB CRD (a new operator is checked again after its sync, and the deploy step fails `FERRET_CRD_MISSING`) |
| `UPGRADE_REQUIRED`, `DOWNGRADE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `VERSION_UNKNOWN` | The target runs other versions (below) |
| `PATCH_USE_TPG_PATCH` | A running operator or instance would get other patch files than it runs with (Round 15): use tpg-patch |
| `UNREACHABLE` | The API server does not answer the hub |

Warnings (the run goes on): `ORPHAN_CRD` (Postgres CRDs without any operator: the operator sync adopts them), `HA_NODES_EXCEED_ZONES` (an HA instance has more database pods, 1 + `readReplicas`, than the data pool has zones: the 4.5 release notes say that Patroni does not fail over automatically when the zone holding the leader and the synchronous standby is lost), `EXPOSURE_UNRESTRICTED` (`loadBalancer` without `allowedSourceRanges`), `FERRET_EXTENSION_REQUIRED` (a run with `ferret=true`: FerretDB needs the documentdb extension in the instance, which the workflows do not install).

**FerretDB** (design decision D71, Tech Preview in operator 4.5). With `ferret=true` the chart renders a PostgresFerretDocumentDB named like the instance, in sync wave 2 (after the instance is Healthy). The deploy step then checks that the connection Secrets it names exist (`FERRET_SECRET_MISSING`, with the db Secrets found in `pg-<instance>`; set `ferretSecretName` when the operator names them differently) and that the FerretDB Deployments become available (`FERRET_NOT_READY`, usually the missing documentdb extension). The documentdb extension (`shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron,pg_documentdb_core,pg_documentdb'`, `cron.database_name`, the `documentdb` database) is prepared by the DBA as the 4.5 documentation shows ("Using FerretDB for PostgreSQL for Kubernetes"); extensions are out of scope of the fleet. With `networkPolicy=baseline`, port 27017 is open to the same clients as 5432 (section 9).

**Backups by the operator** (`backupSchedule=operator`, design decision D70). The instance leaves the CronWorkflows (`backup.scheduled: false`) and the chart renders `PostgresBackupSchedule` `<instance>-backup-full` (and `<instance>-backup-incremental` when `operatorIncrementalSchedule` is set), in sync wave 2. The chart refuses the schedules while `backup.scheduled` is not `false`, so an instance is never backed up by both. The backup location's retention policy (`backupFullRetention`, `backupFullRetentionType`) expires the operator's backups like the others: the operator applies it.

`backupEnableSSL=true` needs a CA bundle: `backupCaBundleFile` or `backupCaBundleVaultSecret` (the instance's `clusterMap` key, else its cluster's, else the inputs), else `tpg-settings` `backupCaBundle` (written by `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/run.sh` from Terraform). The plan checks that the bundle holds PEM certificates that have not expired; without any bundle it fails with `CA_BUNDLE_MISSING` before anything changes. Between the steps the plan carries each bundle as `@ca:<first 12 characters of its sha256>@` (one workflow parameter is limited to 128 KiB) and records the PEM once in the run record `ca.<hash>`; the commit writes the PEM itself, and fails `CA_BUNDLE_MISSING` when a bundle is in neither the run record nor `tpg-settings`. The report names the source of every bundle that does not come from `tpg-settings` (`CA_BUNDLE <cluster>/<instance> from file ...` or `from Vault tpg/ca-bundles/<name>`).

**Patch files at Day 0** (Round 15, design decision D83). `postgresPatchFilePath`, `postgresValuesPatchFilePath` and `operatorValuesPatchFilePath` (inputs or `clusterMap` keys) work as in tpg-create-instance and tpg-patch: the files are checked in the validate step, stored in the fleet repository, recorded as `current` in `clusters/fleet.yaml` and rendered with the new instances and the operator. They apply to what the run creates: an instance or an operator that already runs with other patch files is `BLOCKED` `PATCH_USE_TPG_PATCH` (change running objects with tpg-patch, which shows the diff and can revert). Local files travel in `patchFiles`: pack them with `scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o <parameter file>` and submit the parameter file (section 7).

**Re-running tpg-day0** on clusters it deployed is safe. The operator and its CRDs are `MANAGED`, instances that run the requested versions are left as they are, new instances are added, and every instance is checked after the sync: `Running`, backup stanza initialized, and its Services following `exposure` (`EXPOSURE_NOT_APPLIED` when the load balancer addresses do not appear within 5 minutes). To add instances to a running cluster without the operator and add-on steps, use tpg-create-instance (section 5).

**Versions: the cluster decides, not `fleet.yaml`.** `clusters/fleet.yaml` starts empty (`clusters: {}`); `clusters/fleet.example.yaml` shows a filled-in file. For each cluster, tpg-day0 compares the requested operator and Postgres versions with what runs on the target:

| On the target | Result |
|---|---|
| The operator (or the instance) does not run yet | The input is written to `fleet.yaml`, replacing any version declared there. The result carries `FLEET_OVERRIDDEN` with the old value |
| It runs the requested version | Nothing to change on the cluster; a different version declared in `fleet.yaml` is replaced (`FLEET_OVERRIDDEN`) |
| It runs an older version | `BLOCKED` `UPGRADE_REQUIRED`: use tpg-upgrade |
| It runs a newer version | `BLOCKED` `DOWNGRADE_NOT_ALLOWED` |
| The running version cannot be read | `BLOCKED` `VERSION_UNKNOWN`, unless `fleet.yaml` already declares the requested operator version |

A blocked cluster keeps its `fleet.yaml` entry as it was; the other clusters go ahead.

Different settings per cluster and instance, with `clusterMap`. The inputs are the defaults (here `operatorVersion`, `postgresVersion` and `highAvailability`), and each map key overrides them:

```yaml

clusterMap: |
  aks-tpg-poc-01:

Several clusters, each with its own patch files and CA bundle source, from one parameter file (Round 15). The local paths are relative to the directory you run the commands in; `pack-patch-files.sh -o` reads every path of the file (inputs and `clusterMap` keys), checks each file and adds the `patchFiles` line:

## 5. tpg-create-instance

Adds Postgres instances to clusters that already run the fleet's operator (deployed by tpg-day0). Each cluster can get its own instances and values (`clusterMap`), or every listed instance goes to every listed cluster. The instance inputs are those of tpg-day0; postgres patch files and a values patch file can be given as well (paths of the machine that submits the run, their contents in `patchFiles`, or `repo:` files of the fleet repository, as for tpg-patch, section 7) and shape the instance from its first render. The postgres files are combined into `charts/tpg-instance/patches/<instance>-postgres-<hash>.yaml`, the values file is stored as `charts/tpg-instance/patches/<name>-<uid>.yaml`, and both are recorded as the instance's current patches. The operator, the add-ons and instances that already run are not touched.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clusters` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Registered clusters that run the fleet's operator (`all` is not accepted) |
| `instances` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | New instances, created on every listed cluster (namespace `pg-<instance>`) |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | no | | Each cluster with its own instances and values (section 3); replaces `clusters` and `instances` |
| `highAvailability` | `Boolean` | yes (input or map key) | | `true` (primary and standby, plus `readReplicas`) or `false` (single node) |
| `postgresVersion` | `String (version)` | yes (input or map key) | | A PostgresVersion the cluster's operator offers |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | yes | | `direct` or `pr` |
| `readReplicas` | `Integer` | no | `1` with `highAvailability=true` | Read replicas, only with `highAvailability=true` (1 to `maxReadReplicas`; empty means 1, 0 is refused). Above 0 with `highAvailability=false` is refused |
| `storageSize`, `walStorageSize` | `String (quantity)` | no | template (`20Gi`, `10Gi`) | Volume sizes |
| `storageClass` | `String (name)` | no | template (`tpg-data-retain`) | StorageClass |
| `cpu`, `memory` | `String (quantity)` | no | template | Request and limit per Postgres pod |
| `backupSchedule` | `Enum` | no | `fleet` | `fleet`, `none` (excluded from the backup CronWorkflows) or `operator` (PostgresBackupSchedule objects instead, section 4) |
| `operatorFullSchedule`, `operatorIncrementalSchedule` | `String (cron)` | no | `0 0 * * 0`, `0 0 * * 1-6` | As tpg-day0 |
| `backupEnableSSL` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | As tpg-day0; `true` writes a CA bundle as `caBundle` |
| `backupCaBundleFile` | `String (file path)` | no | | As tpg-day0: the CA bundle as a PEM file (section 14) |
| `backupCaBundleVaultSecret` | `String (name)` | no | | As tpg-day0: the CA bundle from Vault `tpg/ca-bundles/<name>` (section 14) |
| `backupFullRetention` | `Integer` | no | template (`4`) | As tpg-day0 |
| `backupFullRetentionType` | `Enum` | no | template (`count`) | As tpg-day0: `count` or `time` |
| `exposure`, `readOnlyExposure` | `Enum` | no | `clusterIP` | As tpg-day0 |
| `serviceAnnotations`, `readOnlyServiceAnnotations` | `Map` | no | | As tpg-day0 |
| `allowedSourceRanges` | `List (CIDRs)` | no | | As tpg-day0 |
| `internalLoadBalancerSubnet` | `String (Azure name)` | no | | As tpg-day0 |
| `networkPolicy` | `Enum` | no | `none` | As tpg-day0 (section 9) |
| `ingressFromNamespaces` | `List` | no | | As tpg-day0 |
| `ingressFromPodLabels` | `Map` | no | | As tpg-day0 |
| `ingressFromCidrs`, `egressToCidrs` | `List (CIDRs)` | no | | As tpg-day0 |
| `egressToFqdns` | `List (host names)` | no | | As tpg-day0; needs ACNS |
| `ferret` | `Boolean` | no | | As tpg-day0: a FerretDB for each new instance (Postgres 17.5 or later) |
| `ferretReplicas`, `ferretReadOnlyReplicas` | `Integer` | no | `1`, `0` | As tpg-day0 |
| `ferretExposure` | `Enum` | no | `clusterIP` | As tpg-day0 |
| `ferretSecretName`, `ferretReadOnlySecretName` | `String (name)` | no | | As tpg-day0 |
| `postgresPatchFilePath` | `List (file paths)` | no | | Files of Postgres, PostgresBackupLocation, PostgresBackupSchedule and PostgresFerretDocumentDB documents, merged into the new instance's objects (creation rules below; section 7) |
| `postgresValuesPatchFilePath` | `String (file path)` | no | | A tpg-instance chart values file (renamed from `valuesPatchFilePath` in Round 15) |
| `patchFiles` | `Map (JSON)` | with a local file | | The contents of the local files, `{"<path as given>": "<base64>"}`: `scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o <parameter file>` writes it into the parameter file, `scripts/submit/tpg-create-instance.sh` fills it |
| `maxParallel` | `Integer` | no | `2` | Clusters per batch after the canary |
| `rolloutMode` | `Enum` | no | `canary` | `canary`, `batches` or `all` (section 2) |
| `dryRun` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | Validate, plan, pre-check and dry-run; push and deploy nothing |
| `syncTimeoutSeconds`, `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `1800`, `3600` | Per cluster, pull request |

The run, in order:

1. **Validate** the inputs and `clusterMap`; each patch file must be in `patchFiles` and fit its input (section 7, step 1).
2. **Plan** `clusters/fleet.yaml` (nothing is pushed yet). Per cluster: the operator must run (`OPERATOR_NOT_INSTALLED` otherwise) and be declared in `fleet.yaml` (`NOT_IN_FLEET`). Per instance: the patch files are stored under their UID names and checked against the creation rules (a declared instance whose current file holds the same contents keeps it, so a repeated run stays `ALREADY_EXISTS`), the instance is rendered with the chart, and the rendered Postgres object is sent to the cluster with `--dry-run=server` (in namespace `default`, under the name `tpg-create-probe`, because `pg-<instance>` does not exist yet), so the operator's admission webhooks judge it before anything is written.
3. **Pre-check** as tpg-day0, with the operator required to be `MANAGED` (section 4).
4. **Commit** the plan of the clusters that passed, without the instances that were blocked, with the stored patch files their entries reference.
5. **Deploy** the new instance Applications, canary first, one run at a time per cluster (the mutex `tpg-cluster-<cluster>`, shared with tpg-day0, tpg-patch, tpg-network-policy and tpg-delete-apps). Each instance is checked like in tpg-day0: `Running`, backup stanza, FerretDB when `ferret=true`, Services following `exposure`.
6. **Gate:** the run ends `Failed` when a cluster or an instance was `BLOCKED`.

| Result of an instance | When |
|---|---|
| `SUCCEEDED` | Created and checked |
| `SUCCEEDED` `ALREADY_EXISTS` | Declared in `fleet.yaml` and running with the requested values: nothing changed, so a re-run is safe |
| `BLOCKED` `INSTANCE_EXISTS` | It runs with other values or another version: use tpg-patch, tpg-scale-instance or tpg-upgrade |
| `BLOCKED` `INSTANCE_NAME_IN_USE` | A Postgres of that name runs but is not declared in `fleet.yaml` |
| `BLOCKED` `PATCH_REFUSED` | A patch file breaks a creation rule (the detail names the file and the field), or a `repo:` file is not on the fleet branch |
| `BLOCKED` `RENDER_FAILED`, `DRY_RUN_REJECTED` | The chart cannot render the instance, or the API server or the operator's webhooks refuse it |

An instance that is declared in `fleet.yaml` but absent on the cluster (for example after a blocked tpg-day0) is deployed from its entry, with the note `DECLARED_NOT_DEPLOYED`.

**Creation rules for patch files.** Nothing runs yet, so a patch file may set more than in tpg-patch: sizes and `spec.storageClassName` are allowed. Refused, because each of these values has one source:

| Document or file | Refused |
|---|---|
| Every postgres patch document | Anything but `apiVersion: sql.tanzu.vmware.com/v1`, `kind` and `spec` (a PostgresBackupSchedule also `metadata.name`); a field the CRD of its kind does not have; a second document for the same object (in one file or across the files of the run) |
| `Postgres` | `spec.postgresVersion`, `spec.highAvailability` (the inputs); `spec.serviceType`, `spec.serviceAnnotations`, `spec.readOnlyServiceType`, `spec.readOnlyServiceAnnotations` (the exposure inputs) |
| `PostgresBackupLocation` | `spec.storage.s3`, `gcs`, `pvc` (the fleet backs up to Azure Blob); `spec.storage.azure.secret` (from Vault); `spec.storage.azure.enableSSL`, `caBundle` (the inputs `backupEnableSSL`, `backupCaBundleFile`, `backupCaBundleVaultSecret`) |
| `PostgresBackupSchedule` | A `metadata.name` other than `<instance>-backup-full` or `<instance>-backup-incremental` (or `backup-full`, `backup-incremental`); `spec.backupTemplate.spec.sourceInstance`, `type` (set by the chart); `expire` (it would expire every scheduled backup; the backup location's retention policy expires backups) |
| Values patch | A key the chart does not have; `instance.name`, `instance.postgresVersion`, `instance.highAvailability`, `instance.serviceType` (replaced by `instance.exposure`), `cluster`, `patches`, `valuesOverride` (tpg-restore) |

## 6. tpg-upgrade

Upgrades the operator (`component=operator`) or Postgres instances (`component=postgres`), canary first, and writes the new version to `clusters/fleet.yaml`. With `clusterMap`, one run can upgrade the operator and instances to versions that differ per cluster and per instance.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `component` | `Enum` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | `operator` or `postgres`. With `clusterMap`: limits the run to that part, and makes `targetVersion` its default version |
| `targetVersion` | `String (version)` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Operator: `v4.5.1`; Postgres: `postgres-17.6` |
| `clusters` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Registered clusters or `all` |
| `instances` | `List` | yes for `postgres`, without `clusterMap` | | Instances or `all`; not allowed for `operator` |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | no | | `operatorVersion` per cluster, `postgresVersion`, `preUpgradeBackup` and `allowMajor` per instance (section 3) |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | yes | | `direct` or `pr` |
| `preUpgradeBackup` | `Boolean` | no | `true` | Full backup of each affected instance first |
| `allowMajor` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | Allow major Postgres upgrades; pauses for approval before every batch after the canary |
| `maxParallel` | `Integer` | no | `1` | Clusters per batch after the canary |
| `rolloutMode` | `Enum` | no | `canary` | `canary`, `batches` or `all` (section 2). With `allowMajor=true`, the approval pause comes before every batch after the first |
| `dryRun` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | Record the planned upgrade (minor or major, current and target) per target |
| `timeoutSeconds`, `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `1800`, `3600` | Per cluster (operator) or per instance (Postgres) |

Minor or major is detected per instance. Downgrades fail. Instances not selected are reported as `SKIPPED_NOT_SELECTED`. An operator upgrade requires every instance that exists on the cluster to be `Running`; an instance declared in `fleet.yaml` that does not exist on the cluster (never deployed, for example after a blocked tpg-day0) is left out with the warning `INSTANCE_NOT_DEPLOYED`. Only a NotFound answer counts as absent: any other error reading the instance (API timeout, permissions) fails the cluster with `CLUSTER_API_ERROR`. With `clusterMap`, every listed instance must be declared on its cluster, and on each cluster the operator is upgraded first; the Postgres part does not start on a cluster whose operator upgrade failed.

A Postgres upgrade of one instance runs in this order:

1. Full backup (`preUpgradeBackup=true`).
2. `PostgresVersionUpgrade` created on the target and followed with the instance pods printed every 5 seconds; `Failed` or `PreCheckFailed` ends the instance as `FAILED` with the operator's message.
3. The instance is `Running` with the target `status.dbVersion` (`DB_VERSION_MISMATCH` otherwise).
4. The workflow waits up to 5 minutes for the operator to set `spec.postgresVersion.name` to the target (each poll is logged); if it does not, it logs that and goes on, because Argo CD ignores that field.
5. The version is written to `clusters/fleet.yaml`, pushed, and the Application is synced at that commit.
6. `SUCCEEDED` only when the Application is Synced. Otherwise the instance is `FAILED` with the sync reason (`SYNC_REJECTED`, `SYNC_DRIFT`, ...) and the detail "database upgraded to ..., but the Application did not sync", and the later batches do not run.

The `tpg-instances` ApplicationSet ignores `Postgres spec.postgresVersion` (`RespectIgnoreDifferences=true`), so the operator's admission webhook (`postgresVersion.name cannot be changed ...`) does not reject the sync.

**The operator image of a values patch.** A current operator values patch (section 7) that sets `operatorImage` carries the tag of the running version. The version commit stores a copy of that file with the new tag under a new UID name and makes it current (the old file is never changed and becomes `previous` with its commit), and rewrites its copy `patches/operator/clusters/<cluster>.yaml`, so the image follows the chart. A tag that is not the running version stops the upgrade before anything changes (`OPERATOR_IMAGE_PINNED`); so does an `operator.patches.values` entry that is not `{current, previous}` (`FLEET_ENTRY_INVALID`: a fleet repository written before Round 15).

```bash
# 1. Operator: dry run on all clusters
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-upgrade \
  -p component=operator -p targetVersion=v4.5.1 -p clusters=all -p pushMode=direct -p dryRun=true --watch

# 2. Operator: canary cluster only, through a pull request

  -p pushMode=direct -p maxParallel=2 -p preUpgradeBackup=false --watch

# 4. Postgres minor upgrade of every instance on every cluster
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-upgrade \
  -p component=postgres -p targetVersion=postgres-16.10 -p clusters=all -p instances=all \
  -p pushMode=direct --watch

# 5. Postgres major upgrade of orders-db, with approval between batches
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-upgrade \
  -p component=postgres -p targetVersion=postgres-17.6 -p clusters=all -p instances=orders-db \
  -p allowMajor=true -p pushMode=pr -p timeoutSeconds=7200 --watch
argo resume @latest          # approve the next batch after checking the canary

# 6. Postgres minor upgrade of two instances on one cluster
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-upgrade \
  -p component=postgres -p targetVersion=17.7 -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-02 \
  -p instances='orders-db,billing-db' -p pushMode=direct --watch
```

Different versions per cluster and instance, with `clusterMap`:

```yaml
# upgrade-map.yaml
pushMode: direct
clusterMap: |
  aks-tpg-poc-01:
    operatorVersion: v4.5.1              # operator first, then the instances below
    instances:
      orders-db: {postgresVersion: postgres-17.7}
  aks-tpg-poc-02:
    instances:
      orders-db: {postgresVersion: postgres-17.6, allowMajor: true}
      billing-db: {postgresVersion: postgres-16.10, preUpgradeBackup: false}
```

```bash
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-upgrade --parameter-file upgrade-map.yaml --watch
```

## 7. tpg-patch

Changes settings of deployed operators and instances that no other workflow owns (Round 14, design decisions D76 to D79; Round 15, D81 to D83 and D86). You write patch files, pass their paths (files of your machine, or files of the fleet repository), and the workflow stores them in the fleet repository, checks them, shows what they change, and syncs them. There are three kinds of patch file, each with its own input and `clusterMap` key:

| Input and map key | Level | Stored as | Content | How it is applied |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `postgresPatchFilePath` | instance | one file per instance, `charts/tpg-instance/patches/<instance>-postgres-<hash>.yaml` | One or more files (a list). Each holds one or more YAML documents, `apiVersion: sql.tanzu.vmware.com/v1`, `kind` and a `spec` fragment, of the kinds `Postgres`, `PostgresBackupLocation`, `PostgresBackupSchedule` (with `metadata.name: <instance>-backup-full` or `<instance>-backup-incremental`) and `PostgresFerretDocumentDB`; every field is checked against the CRD of its kind; one document per object | The tpg-instance chart merges each document into the object of its kind (after the chart values, so the document wins) |
| `postgresValuesPatchFilePath` | instance | `charts/tpg-instance/patches/<name>-<uid>.yaml` | A fragment of the chart values; every key must exist in `charts/tpg-instance/values.yaml` or `clusters/_template/`, for example `backup.fullRetention`. Renamed from `valuesPatchFilePath` in Round 15 | Merged into the instance's values before the chart renders |
| `operatorValuesPatchFilePath` | cluster | `patches/operator/<name>-<uid>.yaml` | Only these operator chart values: `operatorImage`, `instanceRegistryRepo`, `ferretDBImageRepo`, `dockerRegistrySecretName`, `certManagerClusterIssuerName`, `certManagerNamespace`, `resources` (`limits` and `requests`, `cpu` and `memory`), `enableSecurityContext`. Any other key fails the run | Copied to `patches/operator/clusters/<cluster>.yaml`, which the `tpg-operator` Application reads as `$fleet/patches/operator/clusters/<cluster>.yaml` |

`backupCaBundleFile` and `backupCaBundleVaultSecret` (inputs and `clusterMap` keys, section 14) replace the CA bundle of running instances with `backup.enableSSL: true`; a run may carry them alone, without patch files.

**Where the files come from** (D83). A path is one of:

- a file of the machine that submits the run: absolute (`/home/me/patches/orders.yaml`), in your home directory (`~/patches/orders.yaml`) or relative to the directory you run the commands in (`./orders.yaml`, `../shared/orders.yaml`). The workflow runs on the hub and cannot read your files, so their contents travel in the input `patchFiles`, a JSON map of the path as you wrote it to the file's base64;
- `repo:<path>`: a file of the fleet repository on the fleet branch, read by the workflow: `repo:charts/tpg-instance/patches/<file>` for the postgres and values files, `repo:patches/operator/<file>` for operator values, `repo:ca-bundles/<file>` for CA bundles. It is not packed. Like a local file, it is checked and then copied to its stored name, so a later change of the repository file changes no instance until the next tpg-patch.

A file is `.yaml` or `.yml` (a CA bundle `.pem`, `.crt` or `.cer`), at most 256 KiB; `patchFiles` holds at most 512 KiB of base64. The stored name is the file's own name plus a unique 5-character UID (`orders-backup.yaml` becomes `orders-backup-k3x9q.yaml`); the postgres documents of an instance are stored together, named by the hash of their contents.

**Packing the local files: one parameter file, two commands** (Round 15, 2ii). Put the inputs, and the `clusterMap` when the targets differ, in a parameter file, then let `scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o` of your tpg-fleet clone read every local path the file names (the path inputs and every `clusterMap` key that names a file), check each file (it exists, has a valid size and YAML, and fits its input, with the same checks as the validate step; a CA bundle holds PEM certificates) and write the `patchFiles` line into the same file:

```bash
cd ~/work/orders-change              # the directory the relative paths start from
~/src/tpg-fleet/scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o patch-map.yaml
argo submit -n argo --from workflowtemplate/tpg-patch --parameter-file patch-map.yaml --watch
```

Run `pack-patch-files.sh -o` again after every change of a path or a file: it replaces the `patchFiles` line. It stops before anything is submitted when a file is missing (naming the directory the relative paths start from) or does not fit its input. The earlier way, `pack-patch-files.sh -o FILE.yaml FILE...` with the files listed on the command line, failed when a listed path was not written exactly as in the parameter file (`orders.yaml` against `./patches/orders.yaml`), or when a later edit of the parameter file dropped the `patchFiles` line: the run then refused the files with "its contents are not in patchFiles". Listing files still works (`pack-patch-files.sh FILE...` prints the JSON for `-p patchFiles='...'`, for a few small files, since Linux limits one command-line argument to 128 KiB), but the parameter file is the reliable form. `scripts/submit/tpg-patch.sh` packs for you. The helper needs bash, jq and mikefarah yq v4; it reads the checks from the clone it sits in, or from `TPG_FLEET_DIR`.

**One current file per kind.** `clusters/fleet.yaml` records, per target and kind, the file that is applied (`current`) and the one before it with the commit that added it (`previous`):

```yaml
clusters:
  aks-tpg-poc-01:
    operator:
      version: v4.5.0
      patches:
        values:
          current: patches/operator/operator-resources-q7m2d.yaml   # repository path
    instances:
      orders-db:
        patches:
          postgres:
            current: patches/orders-db-postgres-3f9a1.yaml          # relative to charts/tpg-instance/
            previous:
              path: patches/orders-db-postgres-c02e7.yaml
              commit: 9b1d4e7a2c5f8b0d3e6a9c2f5b8e1d4a7c0f3b6e
          postgresValues:
            current: patches/orders-backup-k3x9q.yaml
            previous:
              path: patches/orders-retention-a81zd.yaml
              commit: 4f2c1e9a7b3d5c8e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e
```

Only `current` is applied, so a new values or operator file must hold every override you still want: the diff the workflow prints shows what the old file loses. The postgres file is different (D81): its documents are kept per object, and a run replaces only the objects it sends. A run with a `PostgresBackupLocation` document keeps the `Postgres` and schedule documents of the current file, so a team can own the backup location patch and another the resources patch. An entry of another shape (a list, or `patches.values` of an instance) is refused: it was written before Round 15, and a Round 15 fleet starts from a new repository.

**Removing patches: `patchMode=clear` with `clearKinds`** (D82). `clearKinds` (input or map key) names what is removed: `Postgres`, `PostgresBackupLocation`, `PostgresBackupSchedule` (both schedules) and `PostgresFerretDocumentDB` remove those documents from the instance's postgres file (a new stored file holds the rest; with no document left, the file stops being current); `postgresValues` removes the values file and `operatorValues` the operator file of the cluster; `all` removes every patch of the targets. The removed file becomes `previous`. A clear run takes no paths and no `patchFiles`.

**When a patch overlaps the chart values** (D82). Some fields of a postgres document are also chart values, for example `PostgresBackupLocation` `spec.retentionPolicy.fullRetention.number` and `backup.fullRetention`, or `Postgres` `spec.resources` and `instance.resources` (the list is `workflows/params/patch-overlaps.yaml`). The document wins. When the values the chart would render differ, the plan records the warning `PATCH_OVERRIDES_VALUE` with both values, and `scripts/validate.sh` prints it for every current file, so a later change of the value (for example `backupFullRetention` in tpg-day0) is not silently overridden. A document for an object the instance does not render (a schedule without `backupSchedule=operator`, a FerretDB patch without FerretDB) is kept as current, changes nothing now, and is the warning `PATCH_TARGET_NOT_RENDERED`.

| `patchFiles` | `Map (JSON)` | with a local file | | The contents of the local files: `{"<path as given>": "<base64>"}`, written by `pack-patch-files.sh -o` or the submit script |
| `patchMode` | `Enum` | no | `apply` | `apply`: the files become the current patches. `clear`: `clearKinds` are removed |
| `clearKinds` | `List (kinds)` | with `patchMode=clear` | | `Postgres`, `PostgresBackupLocation`, `PostgresBackupSchedule`, `PostgresFerretDocumentDB`, `postgresValues`, `operatorValues`, or `all` alone |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | yes | | `pr`: per cluster a branch and pull request, synced before a person merges it. `direct`: per cluster a commit on the fleet branch |
| `maxParallel` | `Integer` | no | `1` | Clusters per batch after the canary |

| `timeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `1800` | Per operator and per instance |
| `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `3600` | `pushMode=pr`: how long each cluster's pull request may wait for the merge before the cluster is synced back |

The run, in order:

1. **Validate** (before anything is read from Git). The inputs and `clusterMap`; every local file must be in `patchFiles` and fit the input it was passed to: a Postgres manifest passed as `postgresValuesPatchFilePath` is refused with the input it belongs to, chart values passed as `postgresPatchFilePath` likewise, an unknown value or CRD field is named with the closest known key, a second document for the same object is refused, and an operator key outside the list above is refused. When `patchFiles` lacks a file, the message lists the paths `patchFiles` holds and the command that packs them. `repo:` files are checked in the next step, on the clone.
2. **Plan** (every cluster, nothing committed). On a clone of the fleet branch: the targets are rendered as they are, the `repo:` files are read and checked, the files are stored and made current (the postgres documents combined with the kinds the current file keeps), the checks that need `clusters/fleet.yaml` or the cluster run (refused fields below, smaller volumes, the operator image tag, Secrets and issuers that must exist), the targets are rendered again with helm and sent through the API server with `--dry-run=server`, and the diff is printed: objects the patch no longer renders (the sync prunes them) and `kubectl diff --server-side` of the rendered objects against the live ones. The warnings `PATCH_OVERRIDES_VALUE` and `PATCH_TARGET_NOT_RENDERED` (below) are recorded here. A render or admission error blocks the cluster (`BLOCKED` `PATCH_REFUSED`, named in the log and the report). The fields the `tpg-instances` ApplicationSet ignores (`ignoreDifferences`) take their live values first, so the diff shows what Argo CD compares. A target with no difference is `NO_CHANGE` and is not synced; a cluster with none is not planned. A values patch that changes only what the workflows read on the hub and the chart does not render (`backup.scheduled`, which takes the instance out of the backup CronWorkflows) is committed and not synced.
3. **Apply**, canary first like tpg-day0, one cluster at a time per mutex. On a fresh clone of the fleet branch the step checks, renders and diffs again, then makes one commit with the stored files, `clusters/fleet.yaml` and, for the operator, `patches/operator/clusters/<cluster>.yaml`:
   - `pushMode=pr`: on the branch `tpg/patch/<workflow>/<cluster>`, with a pull request into the fleet branch whose body carries the diff. The Applications are synced at the branch commit **before the merge** (the operator first, source 2 of its multi-source Application; then each instance, with prune) and verified: the operator pods and CRD, the instance pods until `Running`, FerretDB and the Services. Then the workflow waits for a person to merge the pull request. Merged: the Applications compare the new fleet branch head with the objects synced from the branch, which are the same, so they turn Synced without a second sync. Closed without merging, or not merged within `prTimeoutSeconds`: the cluster is reverted (below) and the targets are `FAILED` `PR_NOT_MERGED`.
   - `pushMode=direct`: the commit goes to the fleet branch and the Applications are synced at it and verified the same way.
4. **Revert** when the sync or a check fails (or `PR_NOT_MERGED`): with `pushMode=pr` the pull request is closed first, so nobody can merge it any more; then each Application is synced back (at the fleet branch head of the step when it was Synced before, otherwise at the commit it was last synced at) and the branch deleted, so its commit is gone. A pull request a person merged before the failure is undone like `pushMode=direct`: a `git revert` of the commit (of the merge) is pushed to the fleet branch and the Applications are synced at it. The revert keeps every stored patch file `clusters/fleet.yaml` still names, because clusters of one run share the stored name of a file. The targets are `FAILED` with the reason of the failure, and later batches do not run.

With a `postgresVersion` key in `clusterMap`, an instance that runs another version is `SKIPPED_VERSION_MISMATCH` and left out. When a person merges the pull request with changes of their own and an Application stays OutOfSync after the merge, the target is `FAILED` `MERGED_CONTENT_DIFFERS` and nothing is synced or reverted: compare the pull request with the fleet branch.

**Refused fields.** A field that another workflow or input owns, or that cannot change on a running instance, is refused, and the message names the workflow to use. The fields that cannot change are compared with the instance's current postgres file, so documents carried over from creation (where they are allowed) and a value sent again unchanged pass:

| Document or file | Refused |
|---|---|
| Every postgres patch document | Anything but `apiVersion: sql.tanzu.vmware.com/v1`, `kind` and `spec` (a PostgresBackupSchedule also `metadata.name`); a field the CRD of its kind does not have; a second document for the same object |
| `Postgres` | `spec.postgresVersion` (tpg-upgrade); `spec.highAvailability` (tpg-scale-instance); a `spec.storageClassName` other than the current file's, or a document that leaves out the current file's class so that another class renders (compared on the rendered object); a `storageSize` or `walStorageSize` smaller than the instance renders now (compared on the rendered object, whichever file sets it); `spec.serviceType`, `spec.serviceAnnotations`, `spec.readOnlyServiceType`, `spec.readOnlyServiceAnnotations` (set the exposure values in a values patch) |
| `PostgresBackupLocation` | `spec.storage.s3`, `gcs`, `pvc`; `spec.storage.azure.secret`; `spec.storage.azure.enableSSL` and `caBundle` (`backupCaBundleFile`, `backupCaBundleVaultSecret`); `spec.additionalParameters` and `spec.storage.azure.forcePathStyle` other than the current file's, which the `tpg-instances` ApplicationSet ignores on a running instance |
| `PostgresBackupSchedule` | A name other than `<instance>-backup-full` or `<instance>-backup-incremental`; `spec.backupTemplate.spec.sourceInstance` and `type` (set by the chart); `expire` (the retention policy of the backup location expires backups) |
| Values patch | A key the chart does not have; `instance.name`, `instance.postgresVersion` (tpg-upgrade), `instance.highAvailability` (tpg-scale-instance), `instance.storageClassName`, `instance.serviceType` (replaced by `instance.exposure`), `cluster`, `patches`, `valuesOverride` (tpg-restore); smaller sizes; `backup.additionalParameters`, `backup.enableSSL` and `backup.forcePathStyle`, which the `tpg-instances` ApplicationSet ignores on a running instance (set them when the instance is created) |
| Operator values | Every key but the eight above; `operatorImage` with another tag than the cluster's operator version (the image may move to another registry, its version changes with tpg-upgrade, which also moves the tag in the current file); a `dockerRegistrySecretName` other than `regsecret` without that Secret in `tanzu-postgres-operator`; a `certManagerClusterIssuerName` other than the default without that ClusterIssuer; a `certManagerNamespace` that does not exist |

**Switching the backup scheduler or FerretDB of a running instance** (D70, D71). A values patch may set `backup.scheduled` with `backup.operatorSchedules` (`{full: "0 0 * * 0", incremental: "0 0 * * 1-6"}`), and the `ferret` keys (`enabled`, `replicas`, `readOnlyReplicas`, `exposure`, `secretName`, `readOnlySecretName`). The chart refuses what the workflow inputs refuse (schedules while `backup.scheduled` is not `false`, FerretDB below Postgres 17.5, read-only proxies without HA), so the plan reports `PATCH_REFUSED`; FerretDB switched on is the warning `FERRET_EXTENSION_REQUIRED`. The CronWorkflows follow the values patch too: an instance whose current values patch sets `backup.scheduled: false` leaves them. The instance sync of tpg-patch prunes, so a patch that turns the schedules or FerretDB off removes those objects (the Postgres object and its backup location are `Prune=false` and stay).

```yaml
# ./orders-operator-backups.yaml, on your machine
backup:
  scheduled: false
  operatorSchedules: {full: "0 0 * * 0", incremental: "0 0 * * 1-6"}
```

**Changing the exposure of a running instance.** A values patch may set `instance.exposure`, `instance.readOnlyExposure`, `instance.serviceAnnotations`, `instance.readOnlyServiceAnnotations`, `instance.allowedSourceRanges` and `instance.internalLoadBalancerSubnet`, for example `instance: {exposure: internalLoadBalancer}`. After the sync the workflow waits until the Services match (`EXPOSURE_NOT_APPLIED` after 5 minutes); `loadBalancer` without `allowedSourceRanges` is the warning `EXPOSURE_UNRESTRICTED`. The network policy is changed with tpg-network-policy, not with a patch.

```yaml
# ./orders/postgres.yaml, on your machine: two documents, one file
apiVersion: sql.tanzu.vmware.com/v1
kind: Postgres
spec:
  resources:
    data:

## 8. tpg-scale-instance

Sets the read replica count of the selected instances in `clusters/fleet.yaml` (one commit for the run), then syncs and verifies each instance, cluster by cluster as `rolloutMode` says. It also changes `maxReadReplicas`, the cap on read replicas of a cluster, with a scale or alone (Round 14, D80).

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clusters` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Registered clusters (`all` is not accepted) |
| `instances` | `List` | with `replicas`, without `clusterMap` | | Instances to scale on every listed cluster (`all` is not accepted). Each instance must be declared on each listed cluster. Leave it empty to change only `maxReadReplicas` |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | no | | `maxReadReplicas` per cluster, `replicas` and `enableHAIfNeeded` per instance (section 3; examples below) |
| `replicas` | `Integer` | with `instances` (input or map key) | | Read replicas, 1 to `maxReadReplicas`; `0` makes the instance a single node (high availability off) |
| `maxReadReplicas` | `Integer` | no | | The new cap for every selected cluster (`clusters.<cluster>.cluster.maxReadReplicas`, default 3), 1 or more; empty keeps it. It bounds the `replicas` of the same run. A cap below the read replicas an instance of the cluster has, or gets in this run, is refused in the validate step (`MAX_BELOW_CURRENT`) |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | yes | | `direct` or `pr` |
| `enableHAIfNeeded` | `Boolean` | no | `true` | `replicas > 0` on an instance without HA: turn HA on (`true`), or refuse it (`false`): the validate step reads `clusters/fleet.yaml` and fails before any change for every single-node instance that would get `replicas` above 0 (`HA_DISABLED`) |
| `rolloutMode` | `Enum` | no | `all` | `all`: every cluster at once. `canary`: one wave-0 cluster first, then batches of `maxParallel`. `batches`: batches of `maxParallel`, no canary. A failed batch stops the later ones |
| `maxParallel` | `Integer` | no | `2` | Clusters per batch for `canary` and `batches` |
| `dryRun` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | Record the change only |
| `timeoutSeconds`, `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `900`, `3600` | Per instance, pull request |

An instance that is not declared on one of the listed clusters fails the run with `UNKNOWN_INSTANCE` before anything changes. `replicas=0` scales the instance down to a single node, as the 4.5 documentation does: `clusters/fleet.yaml` gets `enabled: false` and `readReplicas: 0`, and the chart renders no `highAvailability` block (design decision D72). It is refused with `FERRET_READONLY_NEEDS_HA` while the instance runs read-only FerretDB proxies (set `ferret.readOnlyReplicas` to 0 with a tpg-patch values file first). The sync removes `spec.highAvailability` from the live object only when Argo CD is the only field manager of those fields; when another manager (the operator) co-owns `enabled` and it stays `true`, the step applies `enabled: false` and `readReplicas: 0` with a server-side apply as field manager `tpg-scale` and records the warning `HA_FIELD_CO_OWNED` with the managers it found. When the new count gives an instance more database pods (1 + `replicas`) than its data pool has zones, the run warns `HA_NODES_EXCEED_ZONES` (section 4) and goes on.

The plan step writes every count and cap in one commit. A cap is written after the counts: when the scale of an instance does not happen (not `Running`, for example) and the instance would be left above the new cap, the cap stays as it was (`MAX_BELOW_CURRENT` on `result.<cluster>.maxReadReplicas`). A run that only changes caps syncs nothing, because the cap is read by the workflows, not by the cluster. When a batch fails, the later batches do not run; the exit handler then gives every instance the rollout did not reach its previous `highAvailability` back in `clusters/fleet.yaml` (one commit) and records it `NOT_RUN`, so no later sync scales it unasked. Instances that ran keep what they got, as their result says.

Then the rollout: the clusters with an instance to sync are put into batches by `rolloutMode` and `maxParallel` (as in tpg-day0, section 2); within a batch every instance of its clusters runs in parallel, one run at a time per instance. Each instance Application is synced at the pushed commit and waited on until the Postgres resource is `Running`; after a 30-second settle (logged) the workflow checks the pods and StatefulSets with the pod watch.

```bash
# 1. Scale out to 2 read replicas
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-scale-instance \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-02 -p instances=orders-db -p replicas=2 -p pushMode=direct --watch

# 2. Dry run of scaling two instances on two clusters to 3
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-scale-instance \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01,aks-tpg-poc-02 -p instances=orders-db,billing-db \
  -p replicas=3 -p pushMode=direct -p dryRun=true --watch

# 3. Scale down to a single node (high availability off) through a pull request
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-scale-instance \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instances=orders-db -p replicas=0 -p pushMode=pr --watch

# 4. Refuse to turn HA on for a single-node instance

# 5. Raise the cap to 5 on two clusters and scale orders-db to 4, canary first
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-scale-instance \

argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-scale-instance \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-03 -p maxReadReplicas=2 -p pushMode=direct --watch
```

Different counts per cluster and instance, with `clusterMap`:

```yaml
# scale-map.yaml
pushMode: pr
rolloutMode: batches
maxParallel: "2"
clusterMap: |
  aks-tpg-poc-01:
    maxReadReplicas: 4                   # the new cap of this cluster
    instances:

      reporting-db: {replicas: 1, enableHAIfNeeded: false}      # refused if reporting-db is a single node
  aks-tpg-poc-03:
    maxReadReplicas: 2                   # cap only: no instance of this cluster is synced
```

```bash
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-scale-instance --parameter-file scale-map.yaml --watch

# replicas as the default of every map instance that has no replicas key

```

## 9. tpg-network-policy

Creates, changes or removes the network policy of Postgres instances. The rules are written to `clusters/fleet.yaml` (`clusters.<c>.instances.<i>.network`) and rendered by the tpg-instance chart, so Argo CD owns the two objects in `pg-<instance>` like the rest of the instance:

- **NetworkPolicy `tpg-ingress`** (every pod of the namespace): selecting the pods makes ingress default deny.
- **CiliumNetworkPolicy `tpg-egress`** (every endpoint of the namespace): an egress section makes egress default deny. AKS runs Azure CNI powered by Cilium (Terraform `network_policy = "cilium"`), which enforces both kinds and adds up their allow rules.

`networkPolicy=baseline` on tpg-day0 and tpg-create-instance sets the same policy when an instance is created.

| Direction | Allowed by the baseline | Added by the inputs |
|---|---|---|
| Ingress | The pods of the namespace (replication, Patroni REST API, pgBackRest, FerretDB to Postgres); the operator namespace; port 9187 (metrics) from `monitoring` and `kube-system`; the Azure load balancer health probe address `168.63.129.16/32` when a Service is a load balancer | Port 5432 from `ingressFromNamespaces`, `ingressFromPodLabels` (in those namespaces, or in any namespace when no namespace is given) and `ingressFromCidrs`; with FerretDB (D71), port 27017 from the same clients, plus the probe address when `ferretExposure` is a load balancer |
| Egress | The namespace and the operator namespace; DNS (kube-dns, AKS LocalDNS `169.254.10.0/24` and the node, UDP and TCP 53); the Kubernetes API server (Patroni keeps its leader lock there); Azure Blob for pgBackRest: `*.blob.core.windows.net` on 443 with ACNS, otherwise any address on 443 (and 80 while `enableSSL` is `false`) | `egressToCidrs`; `egressToFqdns` (needs ACNS) |

A rule is rendered only for a non-empty input, and no peer list is ever empty: an empty list in a NetworkPolicy peer allows every source.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clusters` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Registered clusters (`all` is not accepted) |
| `instances` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Instances on every listed cluster; each must be declared there and exist |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | no | | Rules per instance (section 3); a `postgresVersion` key is a guard |
| `mode` | `Enum` | yes | | `apply`: the baseline policy with exactly the rules given (a rule that is not given is removed). `update`: only the rules given change, the others stay. `remove`: delete both policies (no rules may be given) |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | yes | | `direct` or `pr` |
| `ingressFromNamespaces` | `List` | no | | Namespaces whose pods may connect on 5432 |
| `ingressFromPodLabels` | `Map` | no | | Pod labels allowed on 5432, in `ingressFromNamespaces` or in any namespace |
| `ingressFromCidrs`, `egressToCidrs` | `List (CIDRs)` | no | | Client ranges allowed on 5432 (clients through a load balancer); extra ranges the pods may reach |
| `egressToFqdns` | `List (host names)` | no | | Host names the pods may reach (`toFQDNs`); needs ACNS |
| `connectivityCheck` | `Boolean` | no | `true` | After the sync, check WAL archiving and client access (below) |
| `maxParallel` | `Integer` | no | `2` | Clusters per batch after the canary |
| `rolloutMode` | `Enum` | no | `canary` | `canary`, `batches` or `all` (section 2) |
| `dryRun` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | Plan and dry-run the policies on each cluster; push and sync nothing |
| `timeoutSeconds`, `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `900`, `3600` | Per cluster, pull request |

The run, in order:

1. **Validate** the inputs and `clusterMap`.
2. **Plan.** The rules of each instance (map keys over the inputs) are written to `fleet.yaml`, the two policies are rendered and applied to the instance namespace with `--dry-run=server`. A cluster without CiliumNetworkPolicy (`CILIUM_NOT_AVAILABLE`) or whose dry run fails (`DRY_RUN_REJECTED`, `RENDER_FAILED`) is `BLOCKED` and not written. An instance with `egressToFqdns` on clusters without ACNS fails (`ACNS_NOT_ENABLED`); one that does not exist fails (`INSTANCE_NOT_FOUND`). One commit.
3. **Apply**, canary first, one cluster at a time per mutex: each instance Application is synced at the pushed commit (with prune for `mode=remove`), then:
   - both objects exist, or both are gone for `remove` (`POLICY_NOT_APPLIED`, `POLICY_NOT_REMOVED`);
   - WAL archiving still reaches the backup storage: `txid_current()` (so an idle instance has a WAL segment to switch) and `pg_switch_wal()` on the primary, then `pg_stat_archiver` must show a new archived WAL within 2 minutes (`BACKUP_EGRESS_BLOCKED` when it does not, or when `failed_count` grows);
   - a probe pod in the first `ingressFromNamespaces` namespace (with the `ingressFromPodLabels` labels) must reach port 5432 (`CLIENT_BLOCKED`), and a probe pod in namespace `default` must not, unless `default` is allowed (`NOT_ISOLATED`). A probe pod that cannot run is the warning `PROBE_NOT_RUN`.
4. **Gate:** the run ends `Failed` when a cluster was `BLOCKED`, after the other clusters were applied.

Clients outside the cluster reach the database through a load balancer and are matched by `ingressFromCidrs` on their source address. Check in the lab that the client address reaches the pod unchanged before relying on it (it depends on the Service's `externalTrafficPolicy`).

```bash
# 1. Dry run: baseline policy for orders-db, clients from namespace orders-app
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-network-policy \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instances=orders-db -p mode=apply \
  -p ingressFromNamespaces=orders-app -p pushMode=direct -p dryRun=true --watch

# 2. Apply it on every listed cluster, canary first
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-network-policy \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01,aks-tpg-poc-02 -p instances=orders-db -p mode=apply \
  -p ingressFromNamespaces=orders-app -p ingressFromPodLabels='{app: orders-api}' -p pushMode=direct --watch

# 3. Add a client range, keep the other rules
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-network-policy \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instances=orders-db -p mode=update \
  -p ingressFromCidrs=10.20.0.0/16 -p pushMode=pr --watch

# 4. Remove the policy
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-network-policy \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instances=orders-db -p mode=remove -p pushMode=direct --watch
```

Different rules per instance, with `clusterMap`:

```yaml
# netpol-map.yaml
mode: apply
pushMode: direct
clusterMap: |
  aks-tpg-poc-01:
    instances:
      orders-db: {ingressFromNamespaces: [orders-app], egressToCidrs: [10.30.0.0/24]}
      billing-db: {ingressFromNamespaces: [billing], ingressFromPodLabels: {role: api}}
```

```bash
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-network-policy --parameter-file netpol-map.yaml --watch
```

## 10. tpg-delete-apps

Deletes Tanzu Postgres applications per cluster: Postgres instances (`tpg-instances`) and the operator with its CRDs (`tpg-operator`). Deleting the operator removes these CRDs: `postgres`, `postgresbackups`, `postgresbackuplocations`, `postgresbackupschedules`, `postgresferretdocumentdbs`, `postgresmigrations`, `postgresrestores`, `postgresversions` and `postgresversionupgrades` (all `.sql.tanzu.vmware.com`).

The applications per cluster come from `apps` (JSON) or from `clusterMap`: the instances listed under a cluster are deleted, and `deleteOperator: true` deletes the operator after them.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clusters` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Registered clusters to clean up |
| `apps` | `Map (JSON)` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Cluster to list of `tpg-instances`, `tpg-instances:<i>[,<i>]`, `tpg-operator`. Every cluster in `clusters` needs an entry |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | no | | Instances per cluster, `deleteOperator` and `force` per cluster, `finalBackup`, `purgePvcs` and `purgeNamespace` per instance (section 3) |
| `confirm` | `List` | yes | | Repeat the cluster names (`clusters`, or the clusters of `clusterMap`) |
| `dryRun` | `Boolean` | no | `true` | `true` records the plan; `false` deletes (set `false` explicitly to delete) |
| `purgePvcs` | `Boolean` | yes (input or map key per instance) | | `true` deletes PVCs and Azure disks; `false` keeps them |
| `purgeNamespace` | `Boolean` | yes (input or map key per instance) | | `true` deletes `pg-<instance>` (needs `purgePvcs=true`); `false` keeps it |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | yes | | `direct` or `pr` |
| `force` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | With the operator: also delete Postgres instances not listed, and do not wait for running backups or restores |
| `finalBackup` | `Enum` | no | `true` | `true`, `false` or `required` (fail when the instance is not Running) |
| `timeoutSeconds`, `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `1800`, `3600` | Timeouts |

Order per cluster: instances (final backup, `fleet.yaml` removal, Application removal without cascade, Postgres objects, optional PVC and namespace purge), remaining Tanzu Postgres custom resources, operator (`fleet.yaml`, Application, leftover cluster-scoped objects, namespace `tanzu-postgres-operator`), CRDs. The Azure Blob backup repository is never deleted. With a `postgresVersion` key in `clusterMap`, an instance that runs another version is `SKIPPED_VERSION_MISMATCH` and kept.

```bash
# 1. Plan (dry run) a full clean-up of two clusters
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-apps \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-03,aks-tpg-poc-04 \

  -p dryRun=false -p purgePvcs=true -p purgeNamespace=true -p pushMode=direct --watch

# 3. Different applications per cluster: one instance on 01, all instances on 02 (keep volumes)
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-apps \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01,aks-tpg-poc-02 \
  -p apps='{"aks-tpg-poc-01":["tpg-instances:billing-db"],"aks-tpg-poc-02":["tpg-instances"]}' \
  -p confirm=aks-tpg-poc-01,aks-tpg-poc-02 \
  -p dryRun=false -p purgePvcs=false -p purgeNamespace=false -p pushMode=pr --watch

# 4. Operator only, forcing removal of instances created outside Git, no final backups
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-apps \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-04 -p apps='{"aks-tpg-poc-04":["tpg-operator"]}' -p confirm=aks-tpg-poc-04 \
  -p dryRun=false -p purgePvcs=true -p purgeNamespace=true -p pushMode=direct \
  -p force=true -p finalBackup=false --watch
```

With a parameter file (easier for JSON):

```yaml
# delete-lab.yaml
clusters: aks-tpg-poc-03
apps: '{"aks-tpg-poc-03": ["tpg-instances:scratch-db,test-db", "tpg-operator"]}'
confirm: aks-tpg-poc-03
dryRun: "false"
purgePvcs: "true"
purgeNamespace: "true"
pushMode: direct
```

```bash
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-apps --parameter-file delete-lab.yaml --watch
```

With `clusterMap`, settings per instance:

```yaml
# delete-map.yaml
confirm: aks-tpg-poc-03,aks-tpg-poc-04
dryRun: "false"
pushMode: direct
purgePvcs: "false"            # default of every instance
purgeNamespace: "false"
clusterMap: |
  aks-tpg-poc-03:
    deleteOperator: true
    force: true
    instances:
      scratch-db: {purgePvcs: true, purgeNamespace: true, finalBackup: false}
      test-db: {}
  aks-tpg-poc-04:

      billing-db: {finalBackup: required}
```

```bash
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-apps --parameter-file delete-map.yaml --watch
```

## 11. tpg-delete-instance

Guarded delete of instances (the per-instance step that `tpg-delete-apps` uses). Instances are deleted one at a time.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clusters` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Registered clusters (`all` is not accepted) |
| `instances` | `List` | yes, without `clusterMap` | | Instances to delete on every listed cluster. Each instance must be declared on each listed cluster |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | no | | Instances per cluster, with `finalBackup`, `purgePvcs` and `purgeNamespace` per instance (section 3) |
| `confirm` | `List` | yes | | Repeat the `instances` value; with `clusterMap`, repeat its cluster names |
| `finalBackup` | `Enum` | no | `true` | `true`, `false` or `required` (fail when the instance is not Running) |
| `purgePvcs` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | `true` deletes PVCs and Azure disks |
| `purgeNamespace` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | `true` deletes `pg-<instance>` (needs `purgePvcs=true`) |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | no | `direct` | `direct` or `pr` |
| `timeoutSeconds`, `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `1800`, `3600` | Per instance, pull request |

An instance that is not declared on one of the listed clusters fails the run with `UNKNOWN_INSTANCE` before anything is deleted. The instance's FerretDB and its operator backup schedules (D70, D71) are deleted after the final backup and before the entry leaves `clusters/fleet.yaml`: FerretDB would lose its backend, and no scheduled backup may start during the delete. A run that stops earlier (a guard, a failed final backup) leaves both in place.

```bash
# 1. Delete billing-db, keep volumes and namespace
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-instance \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instances=billing-db -p confirm=billing-db --watch

# 2. Require a final backup, purge volumes and namespace, through a pull request
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-instance \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-02 -p instances=orders-db -p confirm=orders-db \
  -p finalBackup=required -p purgePvcs=true -p purgeNamespace=true -p pushMode=pr --watch

# 3. Two lab instances on two clusters
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-instance \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-03,aks-tpg-poc-04 -p instances=scratch-db,test-db \
  -p confirm=scratch-db,test-db -p finalBackup=false --watch

# 4. Per instance settings, with clusterMap
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-delete-instance -p confirm=aks-tpg-poc-01,aks-tpg-poc-02 \
  -p clusterMap='{"aks-tpg-poc-01":{"instances":{"billing-db":{}}},"aks-tpg-poc-02":{"instances":{"scratch-db":{"purgePvcs":true,"purgeNamespace":true}}}}' --watch
```

## 12. tpg-helm-addons

Installs or upgrades the Helm releases on target clusters: `cert-manager`, `vault-secrets-operator`, and for the standalone monitoring option `kps` (Prometheus agent) and `tpg-ksm`. The hub releases (`vault`, `vault-secrets-operator`, `kps`) are installed by `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/run.sh --only vault` and `--only addons`. The `vault` release shows its pod table like the others; it is done when `vault-0` has started (shown as `Started`), because Vault turns Ready only after it is initialized and unsealed, which the next part of the step does.

The steps run `alpine/k8s:1.35.8`, which ships **Helm 4**. Helm 4 removed
the `-a` flag from `helm list` (it lists every release state by default), renamed `--atomic` to
`--rollback-on-failure` and `--force` to `--force-replace`, and takes a registry
domain without a path for `helm registry login`. The shared Helm helpers
(`workflows/scripts/common.sh`, the same block as `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/lib/common.sh`)
select the release states with `--deployed --failed --pending --superseded --uninstalled
--uninstalling` (`HR_LIST_ALL`), which Helm 3 and Helm 4 both accept, so the same script runs on
a workstation with either version. `tpg-fleet/tests/cli-flags` fails the build
when a removed flag comes back.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clusters` | `List` | yes | | Registered clusters or `all` |
| `components` | `List` | no | `auto` | `auto` (cert-manager and vso, plus monitoring when `tpg-settings monitoringOption=standalone`), or a list of `cert-manager`, `vso`, `monitoring` |
| `existingAddons` | `Enum` | no | `skip` | A release that exists with another chart version or other values: `skip` (report `SKIPPED_EXISTS`) or `upgrade` |
| `dryRun` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | `helm upgrade --install --dry-run=server` |

Every component is classified before anything is installed, and the result is reported per release:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `INSTALLED`, `UPGRADED` | The release was created or upgraded by this run |
| `UP_TO_DATE` | Our release, same chart version, same values |
| `SKIPPED_EXISTS` | Our release differs; rerun with `existingAddons=upgrade` to apply |
| `SKIPPED_NEWER` | The installed chart is newer than the pinned version; never downgraded |
| `REUSED_EXISTING` | A cert-manager or Vault Secrets Operator installed by someone else is recent enough and is used as it is |
| `BLOCKED` | Another installation that cannot be reused (a foreign `kps` or Vault, an operation in progress, a controller too old). The cluster is not changed |

While `helm --wait` runs, the pod watch prints the pods of the release's namespace every 5 seconds and stops the install when one cannot start (section 2).

With standalone monitoring, the target's `kps` writes to the hub gateway over https with basic auth: the step first creates the `VaultStaticSecret monitoring/tpg-remote-write` (Vault `tpg/shared/monitoring-remote-write`) and copies the Vault CA to `monitoring/tpg-remote-write-ca`. After the install, the run checks for 5 minutes (`MONITORING_FLOW_TIMEOUT`) that the hub Prometheus receives series labelled `cluster=<cluster>`; if none arrive the cluster ends `FAILED` with `MONITORING_NOT_FLOWING`, and the step log names what to check (the gateway Service, the target's Prometheus logs, the credential). With the Azure option it checks that the `ama-metrics` pods run.

```bash
# 1. Everything the cluster needs, on every cluster
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-helm-addons -p clusters=all --watch

# 2. cert-manager only on a new cluster
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-helm-addons -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-04 -p components=cert-manager --watch

# 3. Dry run of the monitoring agent upgrade on two clusters
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-helm-addons \
  -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01,aks-tpg-poc-02 -p components=monitoring -p dryRun=true --watch

# 4. Bring existing releases up to the pinned chart versions and values
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-helm-addons -p clusters=all -p existingAddons=upgrade --watch
```

## 13. tpg-backup

Creates one `PostgresBackup` per selected instance and waits for it.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `backupType` | `Enum` | no | `full` | `full` starts a new chain; `incremental` holds the changes since the previous backup (the daily schedule); `differential` holds the changes since the last full backup |
| `clusters` | `List` | no | `all` | Registered clusters or `all` |
| `instances` | `List` | no | every instance | Instances or `all`; each must be declared on at least one selected cluster |
| `clusterMap` | `Map` | no | | Instances per cluster, with `backupType` and `backupTimeoutSeconds` per instance (section 3) |
| `scheduledOnly` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | `true` (used by the CronWorkflows): skip instances with `backup.scheduled: false` |
| `backupTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `10800` | Time to wait per backup |

The schedule is one full backup a week and an incremental one on the other days:

| CronWorkflow | Schedule (UTC) | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `tpg-backup-full` | Sunday 00:00 | full |
| `tpg-backup-incr` | Monday to Saturday 00:00 | incremental |

An instance with `backupSchedule=operator` (section 4) is not in the CronWorkflows: its PostgresBackupSchedule objects back it up on their own crons (UTC, the operator's clock). tpg-backup without `scheduledOnly` still backs it up on demand, and the retention policy of its backup location expires its backups like the others.

```bash
# The operator schedules of an instance, and the backups they created
kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n pg-docs-db get postgresbackupschedule
kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n pg-docs-db get postgresbackup -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,TYPE:.spec.type,PHASE:.status.phase
```

**Retention is applied by the operator** (Round 15, design decision D84). The PostgresBackupLocation of every instance carries `spec.retentionPolicy`: `fullRetention` with `number` (`backup.fullRetention`, default 4) and `type` (`backup.fullRetentionType`: `count` keeps the newest `number` full backups, `time` keeps full backups for `number` days), and `diffRetention.number` (`backup.diffRetention`, default 6). pgBackRest expires the older backups after each backup, chain by chain: an incremental depends on the full backup and on every incremental before it, so the full backup and its incrementals expire together. Set the values per cluster or instance in `clusters/fleet.yaml` (tpg-day0 and tpg-create-instance inputs `backupFullRetention`, `backupFullRetentionType`, or a tpg-patch values file), or patch `spec.retentionPolicy` with a `PostgresBackupLocation` document (section 7). A change restarts the instances that use the backup location (operator 4.5 documentation): plan it like a maintenance. The workflow tpg-backup-retention, its CronWorkflow and the key `retentionDays` were removed in Round 15: the operator already applied the policy, so the workflow's own window was a second, conflicting rule. A differential backup depends only on its full backup; the POC uses incrementals and keeps `differential` available for a manual run.

```bash
# 1. Full backup of every instance on every cluster
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-backup -p backupType=full -p clusters=all --watch

# 2. Incremental backup on one cluster
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-backup -p backupType=incremental -p clusters=aks-tpg-poc-01 --watch

# 3. Same selection as the CronWorkflows (skips backup.scheduled=false instances)
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-backup -p backupType=full -p clusters=all -p scheduledOnly=true --watch

# 4. Two instances, wherever they are declared
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-backup -p instances=orders-db,billing-db --watch

# 5. Different instances and types per cluster
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-backup \
  -p clusterMap='{"aks-tpg-poc-01":{"instances":{"orders-db":{"backupType":"full"}}},"aks-tpg-poc-02":{"instances":{"billing-db":{"backupType":"incremental"}}}}' --watch

# Run a CronWorkflow now
argo cron list
argo submit --from cronwf/tpg-backup-full --watch
```

```bash
# What exists, per instance
kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n pg-orders-db get postgresbackup \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,TYPE:.spec.type,PHASE:.status.phase,STARTED:.status.timeStarted
```

## 14. CA bundles and new credential values in Vault

**The backup CA bundle** (Round 15, design decision D86). An instance with `backup.enableSSL: true` verifies the storage account's certificate with the PEM bundle in its PostgresBackupLocation `spec.storage.azure.caBundle`. The workflows write it from one of three sources, the most specific first:

1. `backupCaBundleFile` or `backupCaBundleVaultSecret` of the instance (`clusterMap` key);
2. the same keys of its cluster;
3. the inputs `backupCaBundleFile` or `backupCaBundleVaultSecret` of the run;
4. otherwise ConfigMap `argo/tpg-settings` `backupCaBundle` (written by `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/run.sh` from the Terraform output `backup_storage_ca_bundle`).

A file and a Vault secret on the same level are refused. `backupCaBundleFile` is a PEM file (`.pem`, `.crt` or `.cer`) of the machine that submits the run (packed into `patchFiles`, section 7) or `repo:ca-bundles/<file>` in the fleet repository (`ca-bundles/README.md`). `backupCaBundleVaultSecret=<name>` reads Vault `tpg/ca-bundles/<name>`, key `caBundle` (the workflows' Vault policy `tpg-workflow` may read `tpg/data/ca-bundles/*`). Every bundle is checked before it is written: at least one certificate, none expired. The bundle is written into `clusters/fleet.yaml` (`backup.caBundle`), so a later change in Vault or in the file changes no instance until tpg-patch writes it. tpg-day0 and tpg-create-instance take the sources for new instances, tpg-patch replaces the bundle of running instances; a source for an instance without `backupEnableSSL=true` is refused.

**Named bundles in Vault** are kept with `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/vault-secret.sh`, which talks to Vault through `kubectl exec` into `vault/vault-0` on the hub (the default; no Vault CLI or network path needed) or over HTTPS with `--vault-addr` (the `vault-ui` or `vault-fleet` load balancer, with the Vault CA). It logs in with `VAULT_TOKEN` when exported, otherwise as the Kubernetes auth role `tpg-setup` (kubectl exec) or the userpass account `tpg-admin` (`--vault-addr`; password `VAULT_UI_PASSWORD` or a hidden prompt; `scripts/access.sh` prints it):

```bash
cd ~/src/tpg-aks-infra
# the Azure root CAs from Terraform, as bundle azure-storage
terraform -chdir=terraform output -raw backup_storage_ca_bundle | scripts/vault-secret.sh ca put azure-storage -
scripts/vault-secret.sh ca put azure-storage-2027 ~/certs/azure-storage-2027.pem
scripts/vault-secret.sh ca list
scripts/vault-secret.sh ca get azure-storage | openssl x509 -noout -subject -enddate
scripts/vault-secret.sh --vault-addr https://<vault-ui IP>:8200 --vault-ca-file .work/vault-ca.crt ca list
scripts/vault-secret.sh --yes ca delete azure-storage-2025
```

`tpg-rotate-credential` with `secretType=ca-bundle` writes a named bundle as well, from a PEM file (`caBundleFile`) or a wrapping token (section 16).

**New credential values: wrapping tokens** (design decision D87). A new password or token must never travel as a workflow input: inputs are stored in the Workflow object and shown in the Argo UI. `scripts/vault-secret.sh wrap <secretType> [<name> [<key>...]]` reads the new value from the shell environment (exported variables) or a hidden prompt, sends it to Vault `sys/wrapping/wrap`, and prints only a wrapping token: a reference to the value, valid for 10 minutes and for one read. The value itself is never in a command-line argument or a file:

| `secretType` | The value, from | Written to |
|---|---|---|
| `broadcom-registry` | `BROADCOM_USER`, `BROADCOM_TOKEN` | `tpg/shared/broadcom-registry` (`username`, `password`) |
| `git-read`, `git-push` | `GITHUB_USER`, `GIT_READ_PAT` or `GIT_PUSH_PAT` | `tpg/shared/github-read`, `tpg/shared/github-push` (`username`, `token`) |
| `backup-storage` | the inventory's `backup.storageAccount` (or `BACKUP_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`), `BACKUP_STORAGE_KEY` | `tpg/shared/backup-storage` (`accountName`, `accountKey`) |
| `monitoring-remote-write` | `REMOTE_WRITE_PASSWORD` (16 characters or more) | `tpg/shared/monitoring-remote-write` (`username` `tpg-remote-write`, `password`) |
| `ca-bundle <name> <file>` | the PEM file | `tpg/ca-bundles/<name>` (`caBundle`) |
| `custom <name> <key>...` | one hidden prompt per key | `tpg/custom/<name>` |

```bash
cd ~/src/tpg-aks-infra
read -rs GIT_PUSH_PAT && export GIT_PUSH_PAT        # typed, not echoed, not in the shell history
export GITHUB_USER=tpg-bot
T="$(scripts/vault-secret.sh wrap git-push)"
argo submit -n argo --from workflowtemplate/tpg-rotate-credential -p secretType=git-push -p wrappingToken="$T" --watch
unset GIT_PUSH_PAT T
```

The workflow unwraps the token once. Whoever unwraps it first gets the value, and the token is then void: a run that finds it used or expired fails with `WRAPPING_TOKEN_INVALID` and writes nothing, which also shows that someone else read it. Wrap again and resubmit within 10 minutes.

---

## 15. tpg-restore

Restores one instance to a chosen recovery point. Four things are chosen independently: the source instance, the recovery point (`mode`), where it is restored to, and whether that target already exists.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sourceCluster` | `String (name)` | yes | | Registered cluster that runs the instance to restore from |
| `instance` | `String (name)` | yes | | Source instance (namespace `pg-<instance>`) |
| `mode` | `Enum` | yes | | `time`, `latest`, `backup`, `lsn` or `xid` |
| `targetTime` | `String (UTC time)` | with `mode=time` | | UTC timestamp, for example `2026-09-15T08:30:00Z` |
| `backupName` | `String (name)` | with `mode=backup` | | A `PostgresBackup` name in the source namespace |
| `lsn` | `String (LSN)` | with `mode=lsn` | | Log sequence number |
| `xid` | `Integer` | with `mode=xid` | | Transaction ID |
| `targetCluster` | `String (name)` | no | `sourceCluster` | Registered cluster to restore into |
| `targetInstance` | `String (name)` | no | `<instance>-restore-<yyyymmddhhmm>` | Instance to restore into; the source instance name means in place |
| `confirm` | `String (name)` | when the target instance exists | | Repeat the target instance name: the restore overwrites its data |
| `pushMode` | `Enum` | no | `direct` | Cross-cluster restore to a new instance: how the `clusters/fleet.yaml` entry is published |
| `bestEffort` | `Boolean` | no | `false` | Recover as far as the WAL allows instead of failing |
| `restoreTimeoutSeconds`, `prTimeoutSeconds` | `Integer` | no | `7200`, `3600` | Timeouts |

| Target | What the workflow does |
|---|---|
| New instance, same cluster | A one-off clone in its own namespace, not managed by Argo CD. Delete it when the validation is done, or add it to `clusters/fleet.yaml` |
| New instance, another cluster | The instance is added to `clusters/fleet.yaml` with the source settings (its backup scheduler included, `backupSchedule=operator` too; FerretDB is not copied: the `ferret` block is left out, and when a copied values patch turns FerretDB on, the entry gets `valuesOverride: {ferret: {enabled: false}}`, which wins over patch files; `ferret=true` on tpg-day0 or a tpg-patch values file that sets `ferret.enabled: true` lifts it), its Secrets (from Vault) and its own backup location are rendered from the chart, and the Argo CD Application adopts it after the restore (the operator backup schedules come with that sync) |
| The same instance (in place) | Destructive; needs `confirm=<instance>` |
| Another existing instance | Destructive; needs `confirm=<instance>` |

Before it starts, the workflow reads the source instance's backup location, stanza and Postgres version, and refuses a `targetTime` that is in the future or older than the oldest full backup (`OUTSIDE_RECOVERY_WINDOW`). For a restore into another namespace or cluster it creates a read-only copy of the source backup location there, so `backupSync` lists the source backups for the restore; `mode=backup` restores only inside the source namespace, because a `PostgresBackup` name is namespaced: it needs `targetInstance=<instance>` and `confirm=<instance>` (in place), and the validate step refuses it without them.

```bash
# 1. Point in time into a new instance on the same cluster
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-restore \
  -p sourceCluster=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instance=orders-db \
  -p mode=time -p targetTime=2026-09-15T08:30:00Z --watch

# 2. Latest recoverable point, in place (destructive)
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-restore \
  -p sourceCluster=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instance=orders-db -p mode=latest \
  -p targetInstance=orders-db -p confirm=orders-db --watch

# 3. From one named backup, in place (mode=backup restores only inside the source
#    namespace, so the target is the source instance; destructive)
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-restore \
  -p sourceCluster=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instance=orders-db \
  -p mode=backup -p backupName=orders-db-full-20260914000000 \
  -p targetInstance=orders-db -p confirm=orders-db --watch

# 4. Clone to another cluster, managed by Argo CD afterwards
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-restore \
  -p sourceCluster=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instance=orders-db -p mode=latest \
  -p targetCluster=aks-tpg-poc-02 -p targetInstance=orders-db-dr -p pushMode=direct --watch

# 5. Up to a transaction ID, best effort
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/tpg-restore \
  -p sourceCluster=aks-tpg-poc-01 -p instance=orders-db \
  -p mode=xid -p xid=987654 -p bestEffort=true --watch
```

Afterwards:

```bash
kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n pg-orders-db-restore-202609151030 get postgres,postgresrestore
# The copy of the source backup location is kept on purpose. Delete it only when the
# restore is validated: deleting it also removes the PostgresBackup objects that were
# synced from the source repository into that namespace.
kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n pg-orders-db-restore-202609151030 \
  get postgresbackuplocation -l tpg.fleet/restore-source
```

## 16. tpg-rotate-credential

Creates or rotates a secret in Vault and verifies that the new value reached everything that uses it (Round 15, design decision D87). Nothing is edited in a Kubernetes Secret by hand.

The new value comes from a wrapping token (section 14), or for a CA bundle from a PEM file. The write step unwraps the token, checks the value before writing it (the registry login, a `git ls-remote` and for `git-push` a `git push --dry-run` to the fleet branch, every backup container with the storage key, the password length, the PEM certificates), and writes it as a new version of its KV v2 path. It runs as the ServiceAccount `argo/tpg-credential-writer`, the only identity with the Vault role and policy `tpg-credential-writer` (create, update and read back on the five shared credential paths, `tpg/ca-bundles/*` and `tpg/custom/*`; no delete). The admission policy `tpg-credential-writer` keeps that ServiceAccount to this WorkflowTemplate. In namespace `argo` it refuses a Workflow, WorkflowTemplate, CronWorkflow or ClusterWorkflowTemplate that names the ServiceAccount (in `spec`, `templateDefaults`, a template or an inline template, as `serviceAccountName` or the executor's); a `podSpecPatch` that mentions any ServiceAccount or holds a backslash or `!!` (an escape or a YAML tag could spell the name another way); a `templateRef` to `tpg-rotate-credential` from anything but the template itself; and a run of `tpg-rotate-credential` that brings more than `workflowTemplateRef` and `arguments` (a `podSpecPatch`, `templateDefaults`, `volumes` or its own `entrypoint` would reach the write step). Only Argo CD may change the WorkflowTemplate, and the write step's image is fixed in it, not the `toolsImage` parameter. The same policy keeps the write step's inputs out of reach of the workflow ServiceAccounts `tpg-workflow` and `tpg-credential-writer` (they share one Role): they may write only the run records `tpg-run-*` among the ConfigMaps of `argo` (the step runs its script from `tpg-scripts` and reads the registry host and the fleet repository URL from `tpg-settings`), and may change only the metadata of a pod, not its spec (a new image of a running write step would run as the writer). The policy checks these objects only: keep the right to create pods in `argo` to the Argo Workflows controller and the hub administrators. Without `wrappingToken` or `caBundleFile`, the value was written in Vault by hand, and the run only verifies it.

| Input | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `secretType` | `Enum` | no | `broadcom-registry` | `broadcom-registry`, `backup-storage`, `git-push`, `git-read`, `monitoring-remote-write`, `ca-bundle` or `custom` (table below) |
| `secretName` | `String (name)` | with `ca-bundle` or `custom` | | The name under `tpg/ca-bundles/` or `tpg/custom/`; the other types have a fixed path |
| `wrappingToken` | `String (Vault token)` | no (`custom`: yes) | | The wrapping token of the new value (`tpg-aks-infra/scripts/vault-secret.sh wrap`); single use, 10 minutes |
| `caBundleFile` | `String (file path)` | no | | `ca-bundle` only, instead of `wrappingToken`: a PEM file of the submitting machine (packed into `patchFiles`). A `repo:` file is refused: a bundle kept in the fleet repository needs no copy in Vault, runs name it with `backupCaBundleFile=repo:ca-bundles/<file>` |
| `patchFiles` | `Map (JSON)` | with a local `caBundleFile` | | The contents of the file, written by `scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o` |
| `clusters` | `List` | no | `all` | Registered clusters to verify, or `all` |
| `maxParallel` | `Integer` | no | `5` | Clusters verified at the same time |

```bash
cd ~/src/tpg-aks-infra
# 1. A new Broadcom registry token: wrapped, written, verified on every cluster
read -rs BROADCOM_TOKEN && export BROADCOM_TOKEN
export BROADCOM_USER=me@example.com
T="$(scripts/vault-secret.sh wrap broadcom-registry)"
argo submit -n argo --from workflowtemplate/tpg-rotate-credential -p secretType=broadcom-registry -p wrappingToken="$T" --watch
unset BROADCOM_TOKEN T

# 2. A new storage account key (after az storage account keys renew)
read -rs BACKUP_STORAGE_KEY && export BACKUP_STORAGE_KEY
T="$(scripts/vault-secret.sh wrap backup-storage)"
argo submit -n argo --from workflowtemplate/tpg-rotate-credential -p secretType=backup-storage -p wrappingToken="$T" --watch
unset BACKUP_STORAGE_KEY T

# 3. A named CA bundle from a PEM file of this machine
cat > ca.yaml <<'YAML'
secretType: ca-bundle
secretName: azure-storage-2027
caBundleFile: ~/certs/azure-storage-2027.pem
YAML
~/src/tpg-fleet/scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o ca.yaml
argo submit -n argo --from workflowtemplate/tpg-rotate-credential --parameter-file ca.yaml --watch

# 4. Only verify a value written in Vault by hand
argo submit -n argo --from workflowtemplate/tpg-rotate-credential -p secretType=git-read --watch
```

| `secretType` | Vault path | What is checked after the write |
|---|---|---|
| `broadcom-registry` | `tpg/shared/broadcom-registry` | The hub `VaultStaticSecret` and the Argo CD OCI repository connection, then on every cluster: `regsecret` matches Vault, and a test pod pulls an image |
| `backup-storage` | `tpg/shared/backup-storage` | `backup-storage` matches Vault on every cluster, the backup locations are re-read by the operator, and the Blob container answers with HTTP 200 for the new key |
| `git-push` | `tpg/shared/github-push` | The workflow's own Git credential: a clone and a `git push --dry-run` to the fleet branch |
| `git-read` | `tpg/shared/github-read` | The Argo CD repository credential: `repo-tpg-fleet` matches Vault (Vault Secrets Operator) and the Argo CD connection to the fleet repository is Successful |
| `monitoring-remote-write` | `tpg/shared/monitoring-remote-write` | The value is in Vault; the targets receive it through the Vault Secrets Operator (`monitoring/tpg-remote-write`). The hub gateway still accepts the previous password until `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/run.sh --only addons` rebuilds its htpasswd from Vault, restarts it and checks that every target's metrics arrive: the run records the warning `GATEWAY_NOT_UPDATED` as that reminder. Run it right after the workflow (docs/monitoring.md) |
| `ca-bundle` | `tpg/ca-bundles/<secretName>` | The bundle reads back from Vault with certificates that have not expired. Runs use it with `backupCaBundleVaultSecret=<secretName>` (section 14); running instances keep their bundle until tpg-patch writes the new one |
| `custom` | `tpg/custom/<secretName>` | Nothing in the fleet reads it; the write step checks that every value is a non-empty string |

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `result.vault WRITTEN` | The value was checked and written (the detail names the path, the new KV version and the source) |
| `WRAPPING_TOKEN_INVALID` | The token was used already, expired, or is not a wrapping token: nothing was written; wrap the value again |
| `VALUE_INVALID`, `VALUE_REJECTED` | The value lacks a key of its type, or failed its check (login refused, HTTP 403 from a container, expired certificate); nothing was written |
| `VAULT_LOGIN_FAILED`, `VAULT_WRITE_FAILED`, `VAULT_UNREACHABLE` | The write step could not log in as `tpg-credential-writer` or write the path (the Vault role and policy come from `tpg-aks-infra` `scripts/run.sh --only vault`) |

---

## 17. Interactive submit scripts

`scripts/submit/tpg-<workflow>.sh` starts a workflow without composing the `argo submit` line by hand: one script per WorkflowTemplate (12). Each script reads the inputs, defaults, allowed values and descriptions from `workflows/templates/<template>.yaml` and the types from `workflows/params/types.yaml`, so it stays in step with the template.

1. The targets first: `clusterMap` or the lists, where the workflow takes both. `clusterMap` can be built step by step (the registered clusters are listed from the hub, then the instances declared in your `clusters/fleet.yaml`, then the keys the workflow accepts, with their types), loaded from a file, or pasted. It is checked with the same `clustermap.py` as the `validate` step.
2. The mandatory inputs, each with its type and an example. A value that does not match its type is refused with the reason and asked again.
3. A menu of the optional inputs with their current values or defaults (arrow keys and Enter, or numbers). After each one the script asks whether to set another.
4. A summary, the equivalent `argo submit` command, then Submit, Change optional inputs, or Cancel.
5. The submit: `argo submit` when the argo CLI is installed, otherwise `kubectl create` of a Workflow object (the hub admission policy checks it the same way). The script can then follow the run and print its report.

Requirements: bash 3.2 or later (the macOS bash works), mikefarah `yq` v4, `jq`, `python3`, `kubectl` with a context for the hub; the argo CLI is optional.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `HUB_CONTEXT` | kubectl context of the hub (default: the current context) |
| `ARGO_NS` | Namespace of the WorkflowTemplates (default `argo`) |
| `TPG_PLAIN=1` | Numbered menus instead of arrow keys (also when the terminal is not interactive) |
| `TPG_NO_WATCH=1` | Do not offer to follow the run |

The scripts run from any directory (Round 15, design decision D85). A script finds its tpg-fleet clone through `TPG_FLEET_DIR` when set, otherwise as the clone it sits in (following symbolic links, so a link in `~/bin` works); a copy outside a clone stops with the hint to set `TPG_FLEET_DIR`. Relative patch file paths start from the current directory.

```bash
cd ~/src/tpg-fleet
HUB_CONTEXT=aks-tpg-hub scripts/submit/tpg-create-instance.sh
TPG_PLAIN=1 HUB_CONTEXT=aks-tpg-hub scripts/submit/tpg-network-policy.sh
# patch files: run the script from the directory that holds them
cd ~/patches && HUB_CONTEXT=aks-tpg-hub ~/src/tpg-fleet/scripts/submit/tpg-patch.sh
# from anywhere, through a link or with TPG_FLEET_DIR
ln -s ~/src/tpg-fleet/scripts/submit/tpg-patch.sh ~/bin/tpg-patch && tpg-patch
TPG_FLEET_DIR=~/src/tpg-fleet bash /opt/tools/tpg-patch.sh
```

Some inputs depend on an earlier answer: `tpg-upgrade.sh` asks `instances` for `component=postgres`, `tpg-restore.sh` asks the recovery point of the chosen `mode`, `tpg-scale-instance.sh` asks whether the run scales instances (`instances` and `replicas`), changes only the cap (`maxReadReplicas`), or both, and `tpg-patch.sh` does not submit before a patch file input is set (and `instances` for instance patch files).

**Local files (Round 14, Round 15).** `tpg-patch.sh`, `tpg-create-instance.sh`, `tpg-day0.sh` and `tpg-rotate-credential.sh` read every local file the path inputs and `clusterMap` name (absolute, `~/` or relative to the current directory; `repo:` files are left to the workflow; nothing with `patchMode=clear`) through `pack-patch-files.sh -o`, so a file that is missing or does not fit its input is refused before anything is submitted, and send their contents as `patchFiles`; you never type that input. The equivalent commands they print are the parameter-file form of section 7:

```bash
<tpg-fleet clone>/scripts/submit/pack-patch-files.sh -o <parameter file>
argo submit -n argo --from workflowtemplate/tpg-patch --parameter-file <parameter file> --watch
```

The scripts submit `patchFiles` through a parameter file, so the Linux limit of 128 KiB per command-line argument does not apply to them.

---

## 18. Test data: pgdata

`tools/pgdata/pgdata.py` creates a database and tables on an instance, inserts random rows and reads them back, to try a deployment, a backup and restore, or a network policy with real data. It needs Python 3.9 or later and psycopg 3 (`pip install "psycopg[binary]"`).

The connection is given by hand; nothing is read from the cluster. Reach the instance through its load balancer address (`exposure`), or port-forward its Service first. The credentials are in the Secret `pg-<instance>/<instance>-db-secret`, keys `username` and `password`:

```bash
kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n pg-orders-db port-forward svc/orders-db 5432 &
export PGPASSWORD="$(kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n pg-orders-db get secret orders-db-db-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d)"
PGUSER="$(kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n pg-orders-db get secret orders-db-db-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 -d)"
C=(--host 127.0.0.1 --port 5432 --user "$PGUSER" --sslmode require)
```

The password comes from `--password`, else `PGPASSWORD`, else a hidden prompt (`--password` is visible in the process list). Without a command, or with `--interactive`, the script asks for the connection and the action step by step.

| Command | Options |
|---|---|
| `create-db` | `--name NAME [--owner ROLE] [--if-not-exists]` |
| `create-table` | `--database DB --table [SCHEMA.]TABLE` with `--preset customers\|orders\|sales_events` or `--columns "name:type,..."`; `[--primary-key COLUMN] [--if-not-exists]`. A missing schema is created |
| `insert` | `--database DB --table TABLE [--rows 100] [--batch-size 1000] [--seed N]`: values generated from the column types, loaded with COPY |
| `read` | `--database DB --table TABLE [--limit 20] [--where "COLUMN OP VALUE"] [--order-by COLUMN [--desc]] [--count] [--format table\|csv\|json]`, or `--sql "SELECT ..."` in a READ ONLY transaction |

Column types: `smallint`, `integer`, `bigint`, `serial`, `bigserial`, `real`, `double precision`, `boolean`, `text`, `date`, `timestamp`, `timestamptz`, `uuid`, `json`, `jsonb`, `numeric` or `numeric(P,S)`, `varchar(N)`, `char(N)`, and `identity` for a generated `bigint` key. Identifiers are checked and quoted, values are passed as query parameters, and `--where` takes one comparison (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `like`, `ilike`, `is null`, `is not null`).

```bash
python3 tools/pgdata/pgdata.py "${C[@]}" create-db --name shop
python3 tools/pgdata/pgdata.py "${C[@]}" create-table --database shop --table customers --preset customers

## 19. Follow, approve, stop and clean up runs

```bash
argo list                                   # runs with status and duration
argo list --running
argo list -l workflows.argoproj.io/workflow-template=tpg-day0
argo get @latest                            # step tree of the newest run
argo watch @latest
argo logs @latest --follow
argo logs <workflow> -c main | sed -n '/tpg run report/,$p'
kubectl -n argo get configmap tpg-run-<workflow> -o yaml   # raw results per target

argo resume <workflow>                      # approve a suspended step (tpg-upgrade allowMajor=true)
argo suspend <workflow>
argo stop <workflow>                        # run exit handlers (report), then stop
argo terminate <workflow>                   # stop immediately, no exit handler
argo retry <workflow>                       # rerun failed steps
argo resubmit <workflow> --memoized         # new run with the same inputs
argo delete <workflow>                      # also deletes tpg-run-<workflow>
argo delete --older 7d
```

### Archived step logs

Every step's log is archived to Azure Blob when the step ends (container `argo-logs` of the backup storage account). The Argo UI shows the log of a finished step even after its pod has been deleted, for as long as the Workflow exists (7 days). After that, or from a terminal:

```bash
cd tpg-aks-infra
scripts/wf-logs.sh <workflow> --list              # the archived logs of a run
scripts/wf-logs.sh <workflow>                      # print every step log
scripts/wf-logs.sh <workflow> --grep 'RESULT|POD_' # only the matching lines, per step
make wf-logs WF=<workflow>
```

The logs are deleted by the storage lifecycle rule after 90 days (Terraform `argo_logs_retention_days`).

### Reading a failed step

Every step writes its own result: one line `RESULT <key> <status> <reason>
<detail>` in the step log, one key in `tpg-run-<workflow>`, and the output
parameter the report and the Prometheus metric read. A step that fails before it
gets that far records `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` with the script and line number, so a
run never ends with a bare `UNKNOWN`.

```bash
argo logs @latest -c main | grep RESULT
kubectl -n argo get configmap tpg-run-<workflow> -o json | jq '.data | map_values(fromjson)'
```

Reasons written by the sync engine, the pod watch and the checks before a change:

| Reason | Meaning | Look at |
|---|---|---|
| `SYNC_REJECTED` | The API server or an admission webhook refused the manifests (invalid or immutable field). Not retried | The detail holds Argo CD's message; fix the spec in Git |
| `SYNC_FAILED` | The sync operation failed for another reason, after the retries | `argocd app get <app> --show-operation` |
| `SYNC_TIMEOUT` | The sync operation did not finish in time | `argocd app get <app>`, the pod table in the step log |
| `SYNC_BUSY` | Another operation on the Application did not end in time | `argocd app get <app> --show-operation`; ask the platform team if it is stuck (section 20) |
| `SYNC_DRIFT` | Synced, but resources stay OutOfSync (listed in the detail) | `argocd app diff <app>` |
| `HEALTH_TIMEOUT` | Synced, but not Healthy in time | The Postgres resource `status.currentState`, the pod table |
| `POD_<REASON>` | A pod could not start (`POD_CRASHLOOPBACKOFF`, `POD_IMAGEPULLBACKOFF`, `POD_UNSCHEDULABLE`, ...) | The status, events and logs printed below the pod table |
| `MONITORING_NOT_FLOWING` | A target's metrics did not reach the hub within 5 minutes | `kubectl -n monitoring logs deploy/tpg-remote-write` on the hub, the target's Prometheus logs |
| `UNKNOWN_INSTANCE` | A selected instance is not declared on the cluster in `clusters/fleet.yaml`. Nothing was changed | The detail lists the declared instances |
| `SKIPPED_VERSION_MISMATCH` | The `postgresVersion` key of `clusterMap` differs from the running version; the instance was left alone | The detail holds both versions |
| `FLEET_OVERRIDDEN` | tpg-day0: nothing ran on the target, so the input replaced the version declared in `fleet.yaml` | The detail holds the old value |
| `UPGRADE_REQUIRED`, `DOWNGRADE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `VERSION_UNKNOWN` | tpg-day0: the target runs another version (section 4) | tpg-upgrade, or the running operator and instances |
| `PATCH_REFUSED` | tpg-patch, tpg-create-instance: a file holds a refused field or a second document for one object, a `repo:` file is not on the fleet branch, a CA bundle source names an instance without `backup.enableSSL: true`, or the render or the server-side dry run failed on the target | The pre-check detail names the file, the field and the owning workflow; the step log holds the render error |
| `NO_CHANGE` | tpg-patch: the patch renders the objects that already run (no difference); nothing was committed or synced | The diff in the plan step log is empty |
| `PR_NOT_MERGED` | tpg-patch `pushMode=pr`: the pull request of the cluster was closed without merging, or not merged within `prTimeoutSeconds`; the cluster was synced back and the branch deleted | Run tpg-patch again and merge the pull request while the workflow waits |
| `OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS` | tpg-patch, tpg-scale-instance: an upgrade or a restore of the instance is still running; tpg-patch reverts the cluster | Run the workflow again when it has finished (`kubectl -n pg-<instance> get postgresversionupgrade,postgresrestore`) |
| `SKIPPED_NOT_PLANNED` | tpg-patch: the cluster was blocked in the plan, or none of its targets has a change | The pre-check of the cluster |
| `FLEET_ENTRY_INVALID` | tpg-upgrade: `clusters.<cluster>.operator.patches.values` is not `{current, previous}` (a fleet repository written before Round 15) | Start a Round 15 fleet from a new repository |
| `PATCH_USE_TPG_PATCH` | tpg-day0: a running operator or instance would get other patch files | Change running objects with tpg-patch |
| `CA_BUNDLE_MISSING` | tpg-day0, tpg-create-instance: `backupEnableSSL=true` with no CA bundle source, or the commit found a bundle neither in the run record nor in `tpg-settings` | Section 14 |
| `WRAPPING_TOKEN_INVALID`, `VALUE_INVALID`, `VALUE_REJECTED` | tpg-rotate-credential: the new value could not be read or failed its check; nothing was written | Section 16 |
| `MERGED_CONTENT_DIFFERS` | tpg-patch `pushMode=pr`: after the merge the Application stays OutOfSync, so the fleet branch renders other objects than the ones synced from the pull request (changes made in the pull request, or merged with other commits); nothing was synced or reverted | Compare the pull request with the fleet branch; `argocd app diff <app>` |
| `GIT_PUSH_FAILED` | The commit or the branch could not be pushed, or the pull request not opened | The push token (`tpg/shared/github-push`), branch protection |
| `OPERATOR_IMAGE_PINNED` | tpg-upgrade: the current operator values patch sets `operatorImage` with a tag that is not the running version | Fix the file with tpg-patch first |
| `MAX_BELOW_CURRENT` | tpg-scale-instance: the new `maxReadReplicas` is below the read replicas of an instance of the cluster (in the validate step; in the plan when that instance's scale did not happen) | Scale the instances down in the same run, or choose a larger cap |
| `FOREIGN_OPERATOR`, `FOREIGN_CRD`, `INSTANCE_NAME_IN_USE` | tpg-day0, tpg-create-instance: an object the fleet's Applications do not manage (section 4) | `argocd app get tpg-<cluster>-operator` lists what the Application manages |
| `OPERATOR_NOT_INSTALLED`, `NOT_IN_FLEET` | tpg-create-instance: the cluster has no operator of the fleet, or `fleet.yaml` does not declare it | Run tpg-day0 for the cluster first |
| `INSTANCE_EXISTS` | tpg-create-instance: the instance runs with other values (section 5) | tpg-patch, tpg-scale-instance or tpg-upgrade |
| `RENDER_FAILED`, `DRY_RUN_REJECTED` | tpg-create-instance, tpg-network-policy: the chart cannot render the objects, or the API server refuses them in a server-side dry run | The detail holds the message |
| `SPEC_NOT_APPLIED` | tpg-scale-instance: the live `spec.highAvailability` does not match the request after the sync (and, for `replicas=0`, after the `tpg-scale` apply) | `kubectl -n pg-<instance> get postgres <instance> -o yaml --show-managed-fields` |
| `CA_BUNDLE_MISSING` | `backupEnableSSL=true` (or `backup.enableSSL: true`) and no CA bundle: no `backupCaBundleFile` or `backupCaBundleVaultSecret`, and `tpg-settings` has no `backupCaBundle` (at the plan), or at the commit a bundle in neither the run record nor `tpg-settings` | Section 14; `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/run.sh --only hub-secrets` writes the `tpg-settings` bundle |
| `CLUSTER_API_ERROR` | tpg-upgrade: a declared instance could not be read on the target (an error other than NotFound) | The detail holds the API error; check the cluster's API server and its kubeconfig Secret |
| `AZURE_BACKUP_UNSUPPORTED` | The PostgresBackupLocation CRD on the target has no `spec.storage.azure` (or `caBundle`) | `kubectl explain postgresbackuplocation.spec.storage` on the target |
| `CILIUM_NOT_AVAILABLE`, `ACNS_NOT_ENABLED` | A network policy needs Cilium, or `egressToFqdns` needs ACNS | Terraform `acns_enabled = true`, then `run.sh --only hub-secrets` |
| `EXPOSURE_NOT_APPLIED` | The instance's Services did not reach the requested exposure (load balancer addresses) within 5 minutes | `kubectl -n pg-<instance> get svc`, the Service events (subnet, quota, annotations) |
| `FLEET_CHANGED_DURING_RUN` | tpg-day0, tpg-create-instance: `clusters/fleet.yaml` changed for that cluster between the plan and the commit; the plan was not written for it | Run again |
| `POLICY_NOT_APPLIED`, `POLICY_NOT_REMOVED`, `BACKUP_EGRESS_BLOCKED`, `CLIENT_BLOCKED`, `NOT_ISOLATED` | tpg-network-policy checks after the sync (section 9) | The detail; `kubectl -n pg-<instance> get networkpolicy,ciliumnetworkpolicy` |
| `INVALID_INPUT` (`highAvailability=true needs readReplicas 1 or more`) | tpg-day0, tpg-create-instance: an HA instance with 0 read replicas (D69) | Set `readReplicas`, or `highAvailability=false` for a single node |
| `INVALID_INPUT` (`readReplicas N needs highAvailability=true`) | tpg-day0, tpg-create-instance: read replicas for a single node, in the inputs or on one `clusterMap` entry | Set `highAvailability=true`, or remove `readReplicas` |
| `FERRET_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`, `FERRET_CRD_MISSING` | FerretDB below Postgres 17.5, or an operator without the PostgresFerretDocumentDB CRD (section 4) | `postgresVersion`; `kubectl get crd postgresferretdocumentdbs.sql.tanzu.vmware.com` |
| `FERRET_SECRET_MISSING` | The connection Secret a FerretDB names does not exist 2 minutes after the instance runs | The detail lists the db Secrets of `pg-<instance>`; set `ferretSecretName` or `ferretReadOnlySecretName` |
| `FERRET_NOT_READY` | The FerretDB Deployments did not become available | `kubectl -n pg-<instance> get pods -l 'app in (ferretdb-rw-<instance>,ferretdb-ro-<instance>)'`; the documentdb extension |
| `FERRET_READONLY_NEEDS_HA` | tpg-scale-instance `replicas=0` while FerretDB runs read-only proxies | Set `ferret.readOnlyReplicas: 0` with a tpg-patch values file first |

A `BLOCKED` cluster or instance fails a tpg-day0, tpg-create-instance or tpg-network-policy run in its last step (`gate`), after the other targets were deployed, so a partial run never ends `Succeeded`.

Warnings do not fail a run. They are listed in the Warnings part of the report:

| Warning | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MANUAL_SYNC_DETECTED` | The last operation on a tpg target Application was started by a named user other than `workflow-bot`, or was an automated sync. Section 20 explains why that is refused. The workflow syncs the Application itself at its commit and carries on |
| `ORPHAN_CRD` | tpg-day0: Postgres CRDs exist without any operator; the operator sync adopts them |
| `HA_NODES_EXCEED_ZONES` | An HA instance has more database pods than its data pool has zones: Patroni does not fail over automatically when the zone of the leader and the synchronous standby is lost (section 4) |
| `EXPOSURE_UNRESTRICTED` | `loadBalancer` without `allowedSourceRanges`: port 5432 is open to the internet |
| `INSTANCE_NOT_DEPLOYED` | tpg-upgrade: an instance declared in `fleet.yaml` does not exist on the cluster and was left out (section 6) |
| `PROBE_NOT_RUN` | tpg-network-policy: a probe pod could not run; check that path by hand |
| `FERRET_EXTENSION_REQUIRED` | tpg-day0, tpg-create-instance, tpg-patch: FerretDB was switched on; it needs the documentdb extension in the instance, which the DBA prepares (section 4) |
| `HA_FIELD_CO_OWNED` | tpg-scale-instance `replicas=0`: `spec.highAvailability.enabled` stayed `true` after the sync because another field manager co-owns it; the step applied the single-node values as field manager `tpg-scale` (section 8) |
| `PATCH_OVERRIDES_VALUE` | tpg-patch, tpg-create-instance, tpg-day0: a postgres patch document sets a field that a chart value also sets, with another value; the document wins while it is current (section 7) |
| `PATCH_TARGET_NOT_RENDERED` | tpg-patch: a document patches an object the instance does not render now (a schedule without `backupSchedule=operator`, FerretDB off); it is kept and applies when the object is rendered |
| `GATEWAY_NOT_UPDATED` | tpg-rotate-credential `monitoring-remote-write`: run `tpg-aks-infra/scripts/run.sh --only addons` so the hub gateway accepts the new password (section 16) |

One line in the executor log is **not** an error, however it reads:

```text
level=INFO msg="saving parameter" argo=true src=/tmp/result dst=/var/run/argo/outputs/parameters//tmp/result
```

The Argo executor builds that destination as `/var/run/argo` +
`/outputs/parameters/` + the source path, so an absolute source path always
produces two slashes, and POSIX treats `//` inside a path as one separator. The
failure in such a log is the line above it (`sub-process exited ... exit status
1`): read the step's own `RESULT` line for what went wrong.

## 20. argocd CLI: inspect the sync steps behind the workflows

The workflows call the Argo CD API as the local account `workflow-bot`. Applications: `tpg-<cluster>-platform`, `tpg-<cluster>-operator`, `tpg-<cluster>-<instance>` (project `tpg`, the target Applications), and `tpg-hub-workflows` and `tpg-hub-monitoring` (project `tpg-hub`).

**Only the workflows sync the target Applications.** A sync started elsewhere would bypass the workflow gates: the pre-check, backups, the rollout order, the pod watch, and the revert of a failed patch. Three layers enforce this:

1. **Argo CD RBAC.** People are denied `sync` (which also covers rollback and terminating an operation), `override`, `update` and `delete` on `tpg/*`. `workflow-bot` (`role:tpg-sync`) may get and sync them. The deny lines are a marked block in `policy.csv` (`tpg-aks-infra argo/argocd-values.yaml`; on an existing hub, `scripts/hub/existing/check-argo.sh --yes` adds a line for every subject that could act on project `tpg`).
2. **Admission policy `tpg-application-sync`** on the hub. It refuses a new operation on a target Application unless argocd-server writes it for `workflow-bot`, and refuses switching on automated sync. It also covers a `kubectl edit` of the Application object, which Argo CD RBAC does not see. The Argo CD UI then shows `only the tpg workflows (Argo CD account workflow-bot) may sync tpg-...`.
3. **Detection.** Each workflow sync first checks who started the last operation on the Application, and reports `MANUAL_SYNC_DETECTED` (section 19) when a named user other than `workflow-bot` started it, or when it was an automated sync.

The hub Applications in project `tpg-hub` stay manageable. There is no break-glass role: fix the cause in Git and rerun the workflow.

```bash
# What exists and its state
argocd app list -l tpg.fleet/cluster=aks-tpg-poc-01
argocd app list -l tpg.fleet/component=operator
argocd app get tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-orders-db --show-operation
argocd appset get tpg-instances
argocd cluster list

# Who started the last operation (workflow-bot, or workflow-bot:apiKey for its token)
argocd app get tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-orders-db -o json | jq -r '.status.operationState.operation.initiatedBy'

# Hub workflows (templates, scripts, RBAC, admission policies) after a change in Git: project tpg-hub, allowed
argocd app get tpg-hub-workflows --refresh
argocd app sync tpg-hub-workflows && argocd app wait tpg-hub-workflows --health --timeout 300

# Regenerate Applications right after a fleet.yaml commit (same as the workflows; not a sync)
kubectl -n argocd annotate applicationset tpg-instances argocd.argoproj.io/application-set-refresh=true --overwrite
kubectl -n argocd annotate applicationset tpg-operator argocd.argoproj.io/application-set-refresh=true --overwrite

# Operator upgrade check: the rendered chart version and the fleet value file after the fleet.yaml commit
argocd app get tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-operator -o json | jq '.spec.sources'
argocd app diff tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-operator

# tpg-patch with pushMode=pr: the commit each Application was last synced at (the
# pull request branch until the merge), and the source revisions of the operator
argocd app history tpg-aks-tpg-poc-02-orders-db
argocd app get tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-operator -o json | jq '.status.history[-1].revisions'

# Scale or patch check: the Postgres spec Argo CD will apply
argocd app manifests tpg-aks-tpg-poc-02-orders-db --source git | yq 'select(.kind == "Postgres") | .spec'

# The operator's CRDs and Deployment, which the workflows check directly before hard-refreshing
kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 get crd postgres.sql.tanzu.vmware.com -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Established")].status}'
kubectl --context aks-tpg-poc-01 -n tanzu-postgres-operator get deploy

# Troubleshooting a failed sync (read-only)
argocd app get tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-orders-db --hard-refresh
argocd app history tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-orders-db
argocd repo list

# These are refused for people on tpg/* (RBAC, then the admission policy)
#   argocd app sync tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-orders-db        -> permission denied
#   argocd app rollback tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-orders-db 3  -> permission denied
#   argocd app terminate-op tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-orders-db
#   argocd app set tpg-aks-tpg-poc-01-orders-db --sync-policy automated
```

The delete workflows remove target Applications by removing their `clusters/fleet.yaml` entries (the ApplicationSet deletes the Application without cascade) and delete database objects in order; `argocd app delete` is refused for people.
